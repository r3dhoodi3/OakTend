# Analytics

OakTend's analytics is two things. First, first-party product events: every
one is a row in `public.app_events` (migration 0093), written either by the
client sink at `src/app/api/track/route.ts` (fed by `track()` in
`src/lib/analytics.ts`) or directly by server code through
`trackServerEvent()` in `src/lib/trackServer.ts`. That pipeline is what the
rest of this document describes. Second, Vercel Web Analytics, enabled
2026-09-09: the `<Analytics />` component in `src/app/layout.tsx` counts page
views without setting a cookie and without any identifier that lasts beyond a
day. `src/content/legal/privacy.md` (the Analytics subsection in Section 3)
and `src/content/legal/cookies.md` were reworded in the same change to
disclose it, so nothing on the site claims we run zero analytics.

The rule that stays: no Google Analytics, no ad pixel or retargeting tag, no
session-replay or heatmap tool, and nothing that sets a cookie or identifies a
person. Anything that would need one of those does not go in.

`app_events` has row level security enabled with zero policies. No
anon/authenticated client can read or write it, on purpose - only the
service-role admin client (used by the track route and by
`trackServerEvent`) can touch it. Nothing in the app reads it back today; it
exists to be queried directly against the database.

## Adding a new event

- Server-side (an action, a route handler, a webhook): call
  `trackServerEvent(userId, event, props)` from `src/lib/trackServer.ts`.
  `userId` may be `null` for a signed-out visitor.
- Client-side (a component, fired from the browser): call
  `track(event, props)` from `src/lib/analytics.ts`, AND add the event name
  to `CLIENT_ALLOWED_EVENTS` in `src/app/api/track/route.ts`. An event name
  not on that allowlist is silently dropped by the route - a visitor cannot
  forge an event that isn't listed there.
- Never add a server-only event (one only `trackServerEvent` should ever
  write, like a money-moving or moderation event) to `CLIENT_ALLOWED_EVENTS`
  - that route is public and unauthenticated, so anyone could POST a fake one.

## Payload rule

Every `props` payload is ids and enums only. Never free text, never an
email, phone number, or address, and never a homeowner's actual question to
Ask OakTend. A number (a count, a plan name, a reason code) is fine; a string
someone typed into a form is not. `props` is capped at 1024 serialized
characters by the client route and is logged with a redactor
(`src/lib/logSafe.ts`) if the table is ever missing, but the payload rule
exists so nothing sensitive is ever written in the first place, not because
the redactor is expected to catch it.

## Event list

### Homeowner side

| Event | Fires | Side |
|---|---|---|
| `signup_homeowner` | `src/app/homeowner-signup/page.tsx`, once per signup (the two call sites are mutually exclusive branches - confirmation off vs on - never both) | Client |
| `home_claimed` | `src/app/onboarding/actions.ts`, right after a property insert succeeds. `props: { match_source: "real" \| "manual" }` - "real" means the county assessor had a record for the exact street claimed, "manual" means no matching record, regardless of whether the later ownership-name check passed | Server |
| `plan_built` | `src/app/(app)/dashboard/actions.ts`, `generateMaintenancePlanAction`, only when the build actually schedules new tasks (a no-op re-run fires nothing). `props: { task_count }` | Server |
| `post_job` | `src/app/(app)/contractors/actions.ts` - pre-existing, kept as-is rather than renamed to `job_posted` (renaming would lose historical continuity for no benefit) | Server |
| `choose_applicant` | `src/app/(app)/contractors/actions.ts` - pre-existing; this is the "pro hired" moment, no separate event needed | Server |
| `ask_asked` | `src/app/api/ask/route.ts`, once a question has cleared every gate (home claimed, not over any limit) and is about to be answered. `props: { tier }`. Never the question text | Server |
| `paywall_seen` | `src/app/(app)/plus/page.tsx`, once per render of the upsell pitch (2026-08-30: every pitch render, not only `?reason=` ones - the paywall experiment needs renders per variant). `props: { reason, variant }` - `reason` is one of the values the banners on that page actually check (`job_limit`, `home_limit`, `plan`, `forecast`, `quote`, `ask`, `report`, `tax`, `value`, `insurance`, `documents`, `inspection`) or `direct` for a bare visit; `variant` is the paywall experiment arm, `soft` or `hard` (`src/lib/paywallExperiment.ts`) | Server |
| `checkout_started` | `src/app/(app)/plus/actions.ts`, `startPlusCheckoutAction`, right before redirecting to the Stripe session. `props: { plan, variant }` - `variant` is the paywall experiment arm | Server |
| `checkout_completed` | `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, on `checkout.session.completed` for `metadata.type === "plus_subscription"` - the trustworthy completion signal, not the `?welcome=1` page render, which can beat or lose the race with this webhook. `props: { plan }` | Server (webhook) |
| `checkout_abandoned` | `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, on `checkout.session.expired` for `metadata.type === "plus_subscription"`. `props: { plan }` | Server (webhook) |
| `push_enabled` | `src/components/PushSettingsCard.tsx`, when `Notification.requestPermission()` (via `enablePush`) resolves `"granted"`. Shared by both sides of the app; `props: { side: "homeowner" \| "pro" }` tells them apart | Client |
| `feedback_sent` | `src/app/(app)/feedback/actions.ts`, `submitFeedbackAction`, after a successful insert. `props: { side: "homeowner" }`, never the message text | Server |
| `contact_sent` | `src/app/contact/actions.ts`, `sendContactMessageAction`, after a successful insert (not on the honeypot's fake-success path). `user_id` is always `null`: the account match this route computes is an unverified triage hint, not a confirmed identity, so it is never used to attribute an analytics event | Server |
| `forecast_action_added` | `src/app/(app)/forecast/actions.ts`, `addForecastStepAction`, only when the insert actually adds a reminder (a step already on the list fires nothing). `props: { system }` - a `SYSTEM_TYPES` value, never the task title | Server |
| `forecast_reserve_saved` | `src/app/(app)/forecast/actions.ts`, `saveRepairReserveAction`, after the write lands. `props: { cleared: boolean }` and nothing else: the amount is the homeowner's savings balance, so it never enters analytics | Server |
| `forecast_quote_started` | `src/app/(app)/forecast/QuoteEarlyLink.tsx`, on tapping "Line up quotes" on one of the two highest-risk systems, before the navigation into the prefilled post-a-job form. `props: { system }` - a `SYSTEM_TYPES` value | Client |
| `forecast_incentive_viewed` | `src/app/(app)/forecast/IncentiveViewTracker.tsx`, once per page load when at least one rebate line rendered. `props: { count }` - how many lines, never a program name or a dollar figure. Once per load rather than once per line, so a six-system home sends one beacon, not six | Client |
| `aha_home_score` | `src/components/AhaEventReporter.tsx`, mounted from `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`. Fires the first time this account's dashboard renders a real score with at least one system on file (`eligible={sys.length > 0}`). Reported at most once per account via a localStorage flag (`src/lib/trackAhaEvents.ts`'s `ahaReportedKey`); no server-side dedupe yet, see the note there | Client |

### Pro side

`src/app/pro/actions.ts` no longer carries its own copy-pasted
`trackServerEvent`; it imports the shared one from `src/lib/trackServer.ts`,
same as `src/app/(app)/contractors/actions.ts`.

| Event | Fires | Side |
|---|---|---|
| `signup_pro` | `src/app/pro/actions.ts`, `saveCompanyAction`, right after the contractors row insert succeeds on first-time setup - before the license/CSLB/terms/side-stamp work that follows it, so a signup is counted even if one of those later steps fails | Server |
| `onboarding_done` | `src/app/pro/actions.ts`, `saveCompanyAction`, at the very end of the first-time-setup branch, once the whole wizard has actually finished (terms accepted, CSLB check attempted, preferred side stamped). Distinct from `signup_pro`: one is "the row exists", the other is "the pro is fully set up" | Server |
| `license_verified` | `src/app/pro/actions.ts`, `verifyContractorLicense`, only on the write that actually lands `license_verified_status = 'verified'` - never on a failed or unknown CSLB outcome, and never on the 23505 duplicate-license race (that path downgrades to `failed` before reaching this point). Shared by all three callers: onboarding, a profile save that changes the license number, and the "Verify now" button | Server |
| `deposit_made` | `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, `creditDepositSession`, only on the `apply_deposit` RPC call that actually credited the wallet (never a refused out-of-band amount, an unsettled ACH session, or a failed/retryable RPC). `props: { amount_bucket }` - the deposit rounded UP to the nearest $250, never the exact cents Stripe charged | Server (webhook) |
| `lead_viewed` | `src/app/pro/leads/page.tsx`, once per render of the board, after the closed-job sweep so the count matches what the pro actually sees. `props: { count }` - the number of open jobs shown, never a job id or any lead detail | Server |
| `lead_applied` | Already exists as `pro_apply` (see below); no separate event | - |
| `message_replied` | `src/components/LeadChat.tsx`, the pro side of `send()`, right after a text message the pro sent lands. Client-side (this send path has no server action to hang a `trackServerEvent` call off), so it goes through `track()` and is on `CLIENT_ALLOWED_EVENTS`. `props: { side: "pro" }` - homeowner replies are a separate pass, not covered here | Client |
| `pro_checkout_started` | `src/app/pro/plus/actions.ts`, `startProCheckoutAction`, right before redirecting to the Stripe session. `props: { plan, variant }` - `variant` is the paywall experiment arm, `soft` or `hard` (`src/lib/paywallExperiment.ts`) | Server |
| `pro_paywall_seen` | `src/app/pro/plus/page.tsx`, once per render of the pitch branch (never for a member, a past-due row, or the welcome screen). `props: { reason, variant }` - `reason` is an allowlisted `REASON_COPY` key or `direct`, `variant` is the paywall experiment arm | Server |
| `pro_takeover_seen` | `src/components/pro/ProTrialNudge.tsx`, once per open of the full-screen pro paywall takeover. `props: { variant }` - the paywall experiment arm | Client |
| `pro_checkout_completed` | `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, on `checkout.session.completed` for `metadata.type === "pro_subscription"` - the trustworthy completion signal, mirroring `checkout_completed` on the homeowner side. `props: { plan }` | Server (webhook) |
| `pro_checkout_abandoned` | `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, on `checkout.session.expired` for `metadata.type === "pro_subscription"`, mirroring `checkout_abandoned`. `props: { plan }` | Server (webhook) |
| `feedback_credit_claimed` | `src/lib/proFeedbackServer.ts`, `grantFeedbackCredit`, only when this call is the one that actually moved the $5 (never a retry that found the claim already spent) | Server |
| `free_draft_used` | `src/app/api/pro-tools/route.ts`, right after `claimProDraft` reports `claimed: true` - fires whether or not the model goes on to produce a document, since the taste is spent (and refundable) the moment the claim lands, not at delivery. `props: { tool }` (`estimate`, `invoice`, `followup`, `review_response`, or `overdue`) | Server |
| `aha_first_lead` | `src/components/AhaEventReporter.tsx`, meant to be mounted from `src/app/pro/leads/LeadsBoard.tsx` right where `openJobs.length` is already read (`eligible={openJobs.length > 0}`). Fires the first time this account's leads board renders with at least one open job. **Not wired into LeadsBoard.tsx yet** - that file belongs to a different part of this wave; `src/lib/trackAhaEvents.ts` and the client allowlist are ready for whoever adds the one `<AhaEventReporter>` line. Same once-per-account localStorage flag as `aha_home_score` | Client |

### Already live, unaffected by this pass

`post_job_from_chat`, `hero_demo_play` (client, `CLIENT_ALLOWED_EVENTS`);
`job_won`, `pro_apply`, `direct_request` (server, pro/homeowner-crossing
events already wired).

### Campaign links

`src/app/go/[code]/route.ts`, the first-party redirect behind every
`oaktend.com/go/<code>` bio link and Story sticker in the 2026-09 social
launch (`OakTend-marketing/growth/PRODUCTION-BRIEF.md` item 1). Codes are a
fixed allowlist in `src/lib/campaigns.ts` - `trackServerEvent` does not
sanitize props, so a code is only ever logged as itself when it is on that
list; anything else is logged as the fixed literal `unknown_code`, never the
caller-supplied string.

| Event | Fires | Side |
|---|---|---|
| `campaign_click` | `src/app/go/[code]/route.ts`, on every GET, before the redirect. `props: { code, channel, label, ua_family, referer_host }` - `code` is either a real allowlisted value or the literal `unknown_code`; `channel` is `tiktok`, `instagram`, or `other`; `ua_family` is `mobile` or `desktop`, never the raw User-Agent; `referer_host` is a hostname only, or `null` | Server |
| `campaign_signup` | `src/app/(auth)/recordTermsAcceptance.ts`, at the same point it records `terms`/`pro_terms` acceptance for a brand-new homeowner or contractor account - only when the `oaktend_campaign` cookie the `/go/` route set is present and still resolves to a real code. `props: { code }` | Server |

**Clicks and signups per code, last 7 days**

```sql
select
  props ->> 'code' as code,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'campaign_click')  as clicks,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'campaign_signup') as signups
from public.app_events
where event in ('campaign_click', 'campaign_signup')
  and created_at >= now() - interval '7 days'
group by 1
order by clicks desc nulls last;
```

### Performance

| Event | Fires | Side |
|---|---|---|
| `web_vitals` | `src/components/WebVitals.tsx`, mounted from `NewMessageNotifier.tsx` on both shells, sampled at 10% of page views (`WEB_VITALS_SAMPLE_RATE` in `src/lib/webVitals.ts`). One row per Core Web Vital reported (LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB) via the "web-vitals" library. `props: { metric, value, rating, path, sample_rate }` - `path` is a normalized route PATTERN (e.g. `/pro/crm/:id`), never a full URL or a raw id | Client |

**6. Web Vitals by route, last 7 days (p75, the metric Google's CrUX scoring uses)**

```sql
select
  props ->> 'path' as path,
  props ->> 'metric' as metric,
  percentile_cont(0.75) within group (order by (props ->> 'value')::numeric) as p75,
  count(*) as samples
from public.app_events
where event = 'web_vitals'
  and created_at >= now() - interval '7 days'
group by 1, 2
order by 1, 2;
```

### Usage

| Event | Fires | Side |
|---|---|---|
| `page_view` | `src/components/UsageTracker.tsx`, mounted once in the ROOT layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`), on mount and on every client navigation. `props: { path, side }` - `path` is a normalized route PATTERN, `side` is `pro`, `homeowner`, or `public`. One per route CHANGE, not per return to a backgrounded tab | Client |
| `page_time` | `src/components/UsageTracker.tsx`, when a page is left: a route change, `visibilitychange` to hidden, or `pagehide`. `props: { path, side, duration_ms }` - visible milliseconds on that pattern, clamped to [0, 4h] | Client |
| `ui_click` | `src/components/UsageTracker.tsx`, one delegated capture-phase listener on `document`. Fires only for a click inside an element carrying an explicit `data-track` attribute. `props: { id, path, side }` - `id` is the `data-track` value, `path` the pattern the click happened on | Client |

#### Usage events

Three rules make these three events safe to store, and all three live in
`src/lib/usageTracking.ts` (unit-tested in `usageTracking.test.ts`).

**`routePattern()` - never a raw path.** A pathname can carry a job id, an
invite token, or a typed search term, so `path` is always a normalized pattern:
the query string and hash are cut, and any segment that is a UUID, all digits,
longer than 24 characters, or outside the sanitizer's alphabet collapses to
`:id`. `/pro/leads/<uuid>` becomes `/pro/leads/:id`; `/search?q=roof` becomes
`/search`. Short lowercase slugs (`/p/some-slug-name`, `/huntington-beach`)
stay as themselves, because they behave like enums and are the thing worth
comparing. This is deliberately NOT `normalizeRoutePattern()` from
`src/lib/webVitals.ts`, which collapses any segment containing a digit or an
uppercase letter - correct for a per-route latency number, but it would erase
`/guides/roof-repair-2026`, exactly the page this data exists to measure. The
result is capped at 64 characters, the sanitizer's `MAX_STRING`.

**`data-track` and nothing else.** A click id is read only from an explicit
`data-track` attribute a developer wrote, and it must match
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_:/\-]{0,39}$`. There is no fallback to the button's label,
`aria-label`, `href`, or class - every one of those can contain a string
somebody typed (a pro's business name, a homeowner's job title), which the
payload rule above forbids. An untagged control is simply not counted. Values
are short snake_case (`landing_get_started`, `post_job_submit`) or a prefixed
route pattern: `nav:` for the desktop header strip and `tab:` for the phone
bottom bar (both in `src/components/NavLinks.tsx`), `menu:` for the ToolsMenu
and ProfileMenu rows.

**`page_time` measures VISIBLE time.** The clock starts on a `page_view`,
stops when the page is hidden, and restarts - without a second `page_view` -
when it comes back. So a `page_view` count and a `page_time` count for the same
path are not the same number: one page can produce several `page_time` rows if
the visitor kept tabbing away and back. Sum `duration_ms` per path rather than
averaging one row per view. The 4-hour clamp exists so a laptop closed
overnight on `/dashboard` lands a capped row instead of dragging every
percentile with it, and a negative duration (a clock that went backwards) is
clamped to 0 rather than written, because `percentile_cont` would happily
average it in.

These are the first HIGH-VOLUME events in `app_events`, and the table has no
prune job. Housekeeping, run on whatever cadence the row count justifies:

```sql
delete from public.app_events where event in ('page_view', 'page_time', 'ui_click') and created_at < now() - interval '180 days';
```

**7. Clicks by id per week, last 8 weeks**

```sql
select
  date_trunc('week', created_at) as week,
  props ->> 'id'   as id,
  props ->> 'side' as side,
  count(*) as clicks
from public.app_events
where event = 'ui_click'
  and created_at >= now() - interval '8 weeks'
group by 1, 2, 3
order by 1 desc, clicks desc;
```

**8. Page views by path per week, last 8 weeks**

```sql
select
  date_trunc('week', created_at) as week,
  props ->> 'path' as path,
  props ->> 'side' as side,
  count(*) as views
from public.app_events
where event = 'page_view'
  and created_at >= now() - interval '8 weeks'
group by 1, 2, 3
order by 1 desc, views desc;
```

**9. Median and p90 time on page, by path, last 30 days**

```sql
select
  props ->> 'path' as path,
  props ->> 'side' as side,
  count(*) as samples,
  percentile_cont(0.5) within group (
    order by (props ->> 'duration_ms')::numeric
  ) as median_ms,
  percentile_cont(0.9) within group (
    order by (props ->> 'duration_ms')::numeric
  ) as p90_ms
from public.app_events
where event = 'page_time'
  and created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
group by 1, 2
having count(*) >= 20
order by samples desc;
```

(The `having` is not decoration: a median over three rows is noise, and these
tables are read by eye. Drop it when you are chasing one specific path.)

## Querying the funnel

Run these directly against the database (service-role / SQL editor only -
`app_events` has no policy granting any client role a read).

**1. Signup -> home claimed -> plan built, last 30 days**

```sql
select
  count(*) filter (where event = 'signup_homeowner') as signed_up,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'home_claimed')      as claimed_home,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'plan_built')         as built_plan
from public.app_events
where created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
  and event in ('signup_homeowner', 'home_claimed', 'plan_built');
```

**2. Paywall seen -> checkout started -> checkout completed, by reason**

```sql
select
  props ->> 'reason' as reason,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'paywall_seen')       as saw_paywall,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'checkout_started')    as started_checkout,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'checkout_completed')  as completed_checkout
from public.app_events
where created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
  and event in ('paywall_seen', 'checkout_started', 'checkout_completed')
group by props ->> 'reason'
order by saw_paywall desc nulls last;
```

(`checkout_started`/`checkout_completed` carry `plan`, not `reason`, so their
counts land in the `null` reason row - useful as an overall total, not a
per-reason breakdown for those two columns.)

**3. Ask OakTend usage per day**

```sql
select
  date_trunc('day', created_at) as day,
  props ->> 'tier' as tier,
  count(*) as questions_asked
from public.app_events
where event = 'ask_asked'
  and created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
group by 1, 2
order by 1 desc, 2;
```

**4. Pro signup -> onboarding done -> license verified, last 30 days**

```sql
select
  count(*) filter (where event = 'signup_pro')        as signed_up,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'onboarding_done')    as finished_onboarding,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'license_verified')   as verified_license
from public.app_events
where created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
  and event in ('signup_pro', 'onboarding_done', 'license_verified');
```

**5. Pro checkout: started -> completed -> abandoned, by plan**

```sql
select
  props ->> 'plan' as plan,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'pro_checkout_started')    as started,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'pro_checkout_completed')  as completed,
  count(*) filter (where event = 'pro_checkout_abandoned')  as abandoned
from public.app_events
where created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
  and event in (
    'pro_checkout_started', 'pro_checkout_completed', 'pro_checkout_abandoned'
  )
group by props ->> 'plan'
order by started desc nulls last;
```

## Privacy

OakTend does not sell or share personal data with any third party, and
nothing in this pipeline changes that. `app_events` rows live in OakTend's own
database, are linked to an account only when one is signed in, and are never
sold, licensed, or shared with any third-party ad or analytics company - the
same commitment already stated in `src/content/legal/privacy.md`. The
cookieless Vercel page-view counter never touches this table and receives no
account id, no address, and no free text. Under
CCPA/CPRA, "sale" and "share" are defined broadly enough to cover far more
than a literal cash transaction, and OakTend's core data (home address,
financial details) counts as sensitive personal information, so this is a
hard line, not a preference that could shift later. What remains legitimately
available from this data is aggregate, de-identified statistics with no path
back to an individual record - for example, "the median Orange County home
spends $X/year on maintenance" - published or licensed as a statistic, never
as rows tied to a person.

`gpc_signal_seen` (`src/lib/gpc.ts`, via `trackServerEvent`): logged the first
time a signed-in user's browser sends the Global Privacy Control header
(`Sec-GPC: 1`) in a session, at most once per session. Signed-out visitors
only get the session cookie, never a row: an anonymous client could drop the
cookie and resend the header on every request, which would be an unbounded
service-role insert (red-team finding, 2026-09-02). No props. Since OakTend
does not sell or share data, honoring GPC changes no behavior - this event
exists only as proof the signal was seen. Not yet wired into a request path;
see the comment at the top of `src/lib/gpc.ts` for where it hooks in.
