# OakTend Production Go-Live Runbook

Compiled 2026-07-07 from deploy-hardening research grounded in this exact repo
(14 crons in vercel.json, the 4 Stripe webhook events the code handles, every
env var name the code reads). Full sourced report in the session transcript.
Steps marked OWNER need the owner's accounts/cards; everything else the
assistant can execute.

## Monthly cost at launch
Vercel Pro $20 (Hobby ToS forbids commercial use, full stop) + Supabase Pro
$25 (free tier PAUSES after 7 idle days and has zero backups) + Sentry free +
SendGrid free + UptimeRobot free = ~$45/mo + Stripe's 2.9% + 30c per charge.

## Order of operations
1. OWNER (do first, has lead time): buy domain; upgrade Vercel to Pro;
   upgrade the Supabase project (ref tubkvvfkwggaddcmcjqv) to Pro; START
   STRIPE LIVE-MODE VERIFICATION (business details + bank, can take days);
   create SendGrid (under Twilio), Sentry, UptimeRobot accounts.
2. Pre-deploy code fixes: DONE for the cron/widget middleware allowlist
   (2026-07-07). Still open: renumber the duplicate 0019/0020/0021 migration
   filenames before adopting the CLI workflow (order-sensitive: needs its own
   careful session, see below).
3. SendGrid: authenticate the domain (the DKIM/SPF DNS records it gives you,
   at the registrar), then create an API key with the Mail Send scope only.
   (Resend held this role until 2026-09-22 and still works as a fallback.)
4. Supabase custom SMTP: Project Settings -> Auth -> SMTP -> smtp.sendgrid.net,
   port 587, username the literal string "apikey", password = that same
   SendGrid API key. Then raise the
   auth email rate limit (default sender allows ~2/hour: signups stall
   without this).
5. Supabase Auth settings: Confirm email ON, secure email change ON, leaked
   password protection ON. URL Configuration: Site URL = https://yourdomain,
   redirect allowlist https://yourdomain/** (signup code passes no
   emailRedirectTo, so confirmation links follow Site URL: today that is
   localhost, which would break every real signup).
6. Stripe live mode: "Copy to live mode" each product/price (NEW live price
   ids result); recreate or skip the intro coupon (code self-creates a
   fallback safely); grab live sk_/pk_ keys.
7. Vercel project from the Git repo. Env vars (Production scope; Sensitive
   where noted): NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (Sensitive, NEVER in Preview scope),
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain (no trailing slash; build-time
   inlined, must exist at deploy), STRIPE_SECRET_KEY (live, Sensitive),
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (live), STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET (real
   value after step 9), STRIPE_PRICE_PLUS_WEEKLY/_MONTHLY/_YEARLY,
   STRIPE_PRO_MONTHLY/_YEARLY_PRICE_ID, STRIPE_PRO_INTRO_COUPON_ID
   (optional), CRON_SECRET (Sensitive; this exact name makes Vercel attach
   it as the Bearer token on cron calls), ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Sensitive),
   SENDGRID_API_KEY (Sensitive), SENDGRID_FROM, RENTCAST_API_KEY (Sensitive,
   optional; free key at app.rentcast.io enables parcel pre-fill).
   Never set NEXT_DIST_DIR on Vercel. Leave Supabase vars OUT of Preview
   scope so preview deploys cannot touch the production database.
8. First deploy on *.vercel.app; confirm the 14 crons registered. Then add
   the domain (apex A 76.76.21.21, www CNAME cname.vercel-dns.com), SSL is
   automatic.
9. Stripe webhook (live): endpoint https://yourdomain/api/stripe/webhook
   subscribing to exactly: checkout.session.completed,
   checkout.session.expired, customer.subscription.updated,
   customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_succeeded. (The code also
   handles checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded/failed for the ACH
   deposit flow - add those two if ACH/delayed payment methods are enabled.)
   checkout.session.expired specifically is required for the Pro intro-price
   reservation rollback (src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts) to ever fire:
   without it, a user who abandons checkout after reserving the $9.99 intro
   coupon never gets that reservation released, and permanently loses their
   one intro price. Put its whsec_ into STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET and REDEPLOY
   (env changes need one).
10. Smoke test: anon pages incl sitemap (URLs must show the real domain);
    real homeowner + contractor signups (emails arrive, links land on the
    domain); post a lead end to end; OWNER buys Plus with a real card ($4.99,
    verify webhook 200s + subscriptions row + features unlock, then refund);
    hit one cron with ?secret= expecting JSON, not a signin redirect; open
    /p/<id> and the widget in incognito.
11. Monitors: UptimeRobot on the homepage (5 min), Sentry wizard
    (npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs) in a follow-up deploy. Add one Vercel WAF
    rate-limit rule: /api/* and /signin, ~100 req/60s per IP -> 429.

## Top 5 first-deploy breakages for THIS codebase
1. Crons dead via middleware session bounce: FIXED in code 2026-07-07
   (/api/cron/ + /api/pro-widget/ allowlisted; routes still self-auth).
2. Auth emails linking to localhost (Supabase Site URL): step 5.
3. Auth email throttling (2/hr default sender): step 4.
4. Webhook signature mismatch (test whsec with live endpoint): step 9;
   symptom is charged cards but no subscription row.
5. NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL unset/trailing slash: localhost in sitemap/OG/
   checkout URLs; the home-digest cron silently no-ops without it.

## Future migrations: never again the wrong project
supabase login -> supabase link --project-ref tubkvvfkwggaddcmcjqv (inside
the repo) -> from then on ONLY `supabase db push` (shows target ref +
files, asks confirmation). SQL editor becomes read-only territory.
Prerequisites before baselining: renumber the duplicate 0019/0020/0021
filename pairs into unique slots WITHOUT changing fresh-install apply order
(order-sensitive: 0019_security_hardening's revokes interact with later
grants; do this in its own reviewed session), then
`supabase migration list --linked` + `migration repair --status applied` for
everything the live DB already has.

## Backups, RTO/RPO & disaster recovery

**RPO (recovery point objective).** Supabase Pro includes daily backups only:
up to ~24h of potential data loss, since that is the gap between snapshots.
Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is a paid add-on (needs at least the Small
compute add-on) that replays WAL continuously instead of snapshotting once a
day, cutting RPO from a day to minutes. This project is on Pro's default
daily-backup RPO today. Enable the PITR add-on before real money starts
moving through Stripe: a corrupted DB or bad migration the week after launch
is exactly the scenario PITR protects against, and a once-a-day snapshot
would not. Sources: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/backups and
https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/point-in-time-recovery

**RTO (recovery time objective).** Restores are a manual operation, started
from the Supabase dashboard (or via Supabase support if the dashboard restore
fails), not an automatic failover. Small databases can restore in minutes;
larger databases or PITR restores can take 15-30+ minutes or more, and the
project is inaccessible for the duration with no committed SLA on restore
time. Budget hours when planning around an incident, not minutes, and know
there is no automated failover on a single hosted project: recovery means
someone deliberately clicking restore and waiting.

**Migration hand-apply risk (the real DR exposure here, not a burning
building).** Per `handoff.md`, migrations 0062-0066 were hand-pasted into the
Supabase SQL editor because no CLI link / DB password exists yet, so there is
no rollback and no reliable record of exactly what ran against the live
database. (The old duplicate 0019/0020/0021 numbering was resolved in PR #6
on 2026-08-19 - every migration now has a unique version prefix, so a
`supabase db push` baseline no longer collides.) Mitigation, in order:
1. Finish adopting the `supabase db push` CLI workflow (`npm run db:push`
   already exists) so the SQL editor stops being the apply path, per the
   "Future migrations" section above.
2. Run `supabase migration list --linked` + `migration repair --status
   applied` (using the post-rename version numbers) to reconcile the
   bookkeeping table with what the live DB already has.
3. Keep migrations from 0067 onward idempotent (`if not exists`,
   `create or replace`, guarded `create policy`) so a partial or
   accidentally double-applied migration stays recoverable without manual
   surgery.

**If the DB is lost, checklist:**
- Schema of record is the ordered `supabase/migrations/*.sql` files; until
  the duplicate-numbering fix above lands, treat that ordering as
  best-effort, not authoritative.
- Storage objects (uploaded files, photos) are NOT part of the Postgres
  backup. Supabase Storage needs its own backup/export plan, separate from
  DB PITR.
- Stripe is the source of truth for payments. If wallet balances are in
  doubt after a restore, they can be partially reconstructed from the
  `wallet_transactions` table plus Stripe's event log/dashboard rather than
  trusted from a stale Postgres snapshot alone.

## Weekly 5-minute health check
UptimeRobot red? Vercel cron runs all green? Stripe webhook failed
deliveries? New Sentry issues? Supabase DB size + SendGrid bounce rate.
