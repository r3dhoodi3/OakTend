  // already swallows its own errors) can never take the request down with it.

  // open-ended `|.*\.(?:svg|png|...|xml)$` alternation, which tested the
  // whole path rather than a directory, so ANY route whose URL happened to
  // end in an asset extension skipped the middleware entirely - including
  // /pro/crm/<uuid>.png and /api/win-card/<id>.png, both of which sit behind
  // a session in the app but were being waved past the guard by a filename.
  // Nothing about a trailing ".png" makes a path public, so the rule now
  // names the directories that actually hold static files:
  //
  //   _next/static, _next/image  - Next's own build output.
  //   favicon.ico                - the one asset Next serves from the root.
  //   demo-vo/, photos/, sw.js, warming.html - everything in /public. The
  //   warming screen must be fetchable with no session: the service worker
  //   precaches it for every user, signed in or not, and a 307 to /signin
  //   here would poison the cache with a redirect instead of the screen.
  //
  // Then the root asset and metadata routes generated out of src/app:
  // /icon.svg, /icon-192.png, /icon-512.png, /apple-icon, /opengraph-image,
  // /manifest.webmanifest, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml. Every one of them was
  // already answered with no session (each is named in isPublicPath or falls
  // through the unrouted-GET path in src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts) and none
  // of them ever got a device cookie either (attachDeviceCookie skips the
  // metadata prefixes and anything that looks like a file), so nothing about
  // the response changes - the request simply stops paying for a middleware
  // invocation it could never use. An icon fetched by the OS and a robots.txt
  // fetched by a crawler are not navigations, and there is nothing to guard.
  //
  // These are EXACT names, not an extension pattern. The open-ended
  // `.*\.(?:svg|png|...)$` alternation this file used to end with is what let
  // /pro/crm/<uuid>.png and /api/win-card/<id>.png skip the guard, so the rule
  // stays: name the file, never the extension.
