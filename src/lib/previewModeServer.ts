// WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. Everything here needs a session or the admin
// client, so it carries "server-only" and can never be pulled into a client
// bundle. previewMode.ts must NOT carry that marker - PreviewNotice.tsx and
// the two native checkout screens are client components that import the copy
// constants from it.

// May the CURRENT viewer use the contractor side at all?
//
// Outside preview this is always true and costs nothing - the flag is checked
// first, so no session read and no database round trip happens on a normal
// deploy. That is what keeps C4 ("flag off = byte-identical behaviour") true
// for every pro action this guards.
//
// Inside preview the pro side is closed to the PUBLIC - an anonymous visitor
// gets the coming-soon door and the waitlist - but open to any signed-in
// account, so the team and our testers can use it without anyone having to be
// flagged internal first. The is_internal carve-out this used to require
// (migration 0165) turned every new tester into a database chore; the door the
// lawyer review actually cares about is the one facing the public, and that
// one stays shut.
//
// FAILS CLOSED: no session, or a session we cannot verify, means `false` means
// blocked. The cost of a false block is a signed-in tester signing in again;
// the cost of a false pass is a member of the public walking into a product we
// have told the lawyer is closed.

// renders ProsComingSoon instead of the app for a blocked pro, but a "use
// server" action is a public POST endpoint and is reachable without ever
// rendering that shell.
//
// Redirects rather than throwing. Next masks a thrown Error in production as
// the generic "Something went sideways" boundary, which would tell a blocked
// pro nothing; a flash plus a bounce to /pro lands them on the shell, which
// renders the coming-soon page with the real message. redirect() throws to
// unwind the action, so nothing after this call runs on the blocked path -

// would not have sent the same account.
//
// /onboarding for an account with no home is the homeowner FIRST-HOME setup on
// the same auth user - not a second account and not a role switch. A

//
// THE TRAP THIS EXISTS TO CLOSE. A real (non-internal) contractor signing in
// during the preview gets ProsComingSoon in place of their shell, and every
// way off that page pointed at "/", which is the root page, which sends a
// signed-in user to landingFor(sides), which answers "/pro" for an account
// that prefers the contractor side. "Back to OakTend" therefore looked like a
// page refresh, and an account that ALSO owns a home had no route to it at
// all. Same loop on /signin with no ?next=.
//
// Costs nothing when the flag is off: isProSideOpenForViewer() short-circuits
// to `true` on the string comparison before it reads a session, so this is
// landingFor() plus one function call on a normal deploy - which is what keeps
// C4 (flag off = byte-identical behaviour) true for every landing that uses
// it.
//
// landingFor() stays pure and untouched in src/lib/roleRouting.ts. The preview
// is a property of the DEPLOY and the VIEWER, not of the account's sides, so
// it does not belong in a function whose whole job is to map sides to a path.

// file deliberately does NOT carve out the team. A4 is not about who is
// trusted, it is about the product not charging anybody a cent while the
// lawyer review is open, and an OakTend card is still a real charge on a real
// Stripe account. The team tests the money paths in Stripe test mode with the
// flag off, not in preview.
//
// USE IT AS THE FIRST STATEMENT of an action that would otherwise reach
// Stripe, before any import or property access on the stripe client - the
// structural backstop in src/lib/stripe.ts throws in preview, and a throw
// reaches the person as Next's generic error boundary, which tells them
// nothing. This is the branch that produces a sentence they can read.
//
// Returns a boolean rather than redirecting itself, because the right landing
// page differs per action (/plus, /pro/plus, /pro/billing, /pro/payouts) and a
// couple of the callers return a value instead of redirecting at all.
