// Lightweight "flash" toast that survives a server action + revalidate/redirect.
// setFlash() drops a short-lived, non-httpOnly cookie.
//
// WHO DOES WHAT:
//   sets    - setFlash(), from inside a Server Action (this file).
//   renders - src/components/FlashToast.tsx, on the CLIENT, by reading
//             document.cookie. The cookie is non-httpOnly for exactly this.
//   deletes - the same client component, right after queueing the toast.
//
// The render used to happen server-side: the root layout called readFlash()
// every render and handed the result to FlashBridge. That single cookies() read
// made every route in the app dynamic, so it moved to the client. The
// setFlash/readFlash server contract is untouched - every existing setFlash()
// call site keeps working exactly as before, including the ones that were
// rerouted through ActionResult.
//
// readFlash() stays exported for any server consumer that wants to read a
// pending flash during a render; nothing in the tree does today, and anything
// that starts to should be aware it makes its own route dynamic.
