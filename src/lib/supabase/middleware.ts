  // WHY THIS IS STILL getUser() AND NOT THE LOCAL getClaims() FAST PATH.
  // getUser() costs a round trip to Supabase's auth server on every guarded
  // request (measured 2026-08-30: 75 ms median from a laptop, and it is the
  // single biggest server-side cost in a signed-in navigation). The project
  // signs access tokens with an asymmetric key (ES256 + a published JWKS), so
  // @supabase/ssr's getClaims() CAN verify them locally with WebCrypto and a
  // process-wide cached key: the same measurement run put that at 3.0 ms.
  //
  // It is not used, because getUser() detects something getClaims() cannot.
  // Measured against the live project on a throwaway session: revoke a session
  // (logout scope "local", which is also what a password change and "sign out
  // other devices" do to the OTHER sessions) and GET /auth/v1/user with that
  // session's still-unexpired access token answers 403 immediately. A local
  // signature check answers "valid" for the rest of the token's hour, and so
  // does PostgREST - RLS checks the signature and the expiry, not whether the
  // session still exists - so a revoked session would keep rendering real
  // signed-in pages with real data until its access token ran out. This one
  // call is what closes that window today, and 72 ms a navigation is the price
  // of closing it. Do not swap it without deciding, on purpose, how long a
  // revoked session may keep reading.
  //
  // IMPORTANT: do not run code between createServerClient and getUser().

  // RLS still guards every read downstream, and the segment error boundaries
  // show a retry screen if data loads fail too.
  //
  // Reads only. The fail-open is a UX cushion for someone LOOKING at a page,
  // and the cost of being wrong there is a rendered shell with no data. On a

  // WRITES, and the only thing standing between an unverified caller and the
