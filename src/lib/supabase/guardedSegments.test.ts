// -out stranger as a plain 404 instead of a redirect to /signin - and worse,
// renders for real if the page itself leans on the middleware for its auth.
// That is exactly how /ask shipped: the directory existed for days before
// anything noticed the segment was missing from both lists.
//
// So the route table IS the fixture here. Reading the directory means the test
// fails the moment a new page is added without being declared, which is the
// only version of this check that cannot itself go stale.

// Resolved from this file rather than process.cwd() so the test passes no

// exists, which is exactly what a page nobody links to must not do. Undeclared,
// the unrouted-GET fallthrough lets the request reach the page and the page
