// nothing - somebody who installed the app already knows what OakTend is, and
// every extra word between them and a sign-in button is a word in the way. The
// explaining has to happen somewhere though, so it moves to the first screen
// AFTER sign-in: four short cards, once, then never again.
//
// Kept out of the component so the "should this show at all" rules can be unit
// tested without rendering anything, and so both the client component and the
// server wrapper (AppGuideMount.tsx) read the same list of excluded routes.

//   /onboarding, /pro/onboarding - somebody is mid-setup; a takeover here is a
//     dropped signup, and the guide has nothing to say about a home that does
//     not exist yet.
//   /plus, /pro/plus, /checkout  - a payment screen. Never cover one.
//   /emergency, /emergency-help  - a burst pipe is not the moment for a tour.
//   /signin, /welcome            - not inside either shell today, but a future
//     mount point that is would be wrong to interrupt.
