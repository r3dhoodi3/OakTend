// Shared guard rules for the Ask OakTend prompts.
//
// Ask OakTend is a paid model call on someone else's card, so it should only
// ever do the job it exists for. There is deliberately NO server-side keyword
// pre-filter: every cheap classifier we sketched misfired on real questions
// ("how much paint for a 12x14 room" is arithmetic AND a home question), and a
// homeowner who gets refused once stops trusting the feature. The guard is
// therefore a prompt rule, kept here so the homeowner route and the pro route
// stay word-for-word in sync and so the wording is unit-testable.

// The behaviour half of the rule, identical on both sides. Only the scope
// sentence in front of it changes.

// dropped rather than answered on the sly.

// disagree: this read strictly the last array element and gave up if it was an
// assistant turn, while hasAskableContent scanned backwards past one. So a
// history ending in a stray assistant turn (a malformed client, a replayed
// greeting) was askable but had no photo, and a free user's photo question
// walked straight past the Plus gate on the very shape the other helper was
// written to tolerate. Same helper, same answer, no gap between them.
