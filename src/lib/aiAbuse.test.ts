// Everything here runs against the REQUEST SIDE only: the fences, the caps,
// the gates, and the prompt text the routes assemble. No model is called, so
// this suite costs nothing, runs in CI on every commit, and cannot go green or
// red because the model had a good or bad day. What it pins is the half of the
// defence that is ours: an attacker's text is data, it is bounded, and the
// instruction telling the model so is still in the prompt.
//
// The model's own judgment is the other half, and it is deliberately NOT
// tested here - a suite that needs a paid call per fixture gets deleted the
// first time somebody is in a hurry. Live jailbreak probing is the red-team
// pass (scratchpad/redteam-RT*.md), which is where a real refusal is verified.
