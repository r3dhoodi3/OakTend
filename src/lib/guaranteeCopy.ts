// The two credit-back promises, as one canonical sentence each. They are two
// DIFFERENT triggers and must never blur into one guarantee: ghost protection
// fires when the homeowner never responds, FIRST_APPLICATION_GUARANTEE fires
// when the homeowner responds but picks someone else. Both are unlimited and
// repeat every time.
//
// These live here rather than on any one page because the same promise is
// made in five places (the /pros marketing page, the /pro board, the "not
// selected" list, the billing ledger, and the apply confirm). Wording that
// drifts between those places is a legal problem, not a copy problem, so
// every surface renders these strings verbatim.
//
// Source of truth for the rules: migration 0107
// (supabase/migrations/0107_apply_credit_back.sql), which recreates
// choose_applicant() so EVERY non-chosen applicant with a live, paid fee gets
// 100% of it back as credit, every time, no license required. This
// superseded the older, narrower migration 0044 rule (once per contractor
// ever, first paid application only, license-gated), which 0107's own header
// spells out: "a second or third applicant who lost simply forfeited their
// fee [under 0044]. This makes losing a pick cost the pro nothing [as of
// 0107]." 0044's function still runs as a narrow backstop for a job that
// dies unresolved without ever being picked (closed, expired, or stale 30+
// days) - see the daily cron at
// src/app/api/cron/first-apply-guarantee/route.ts - but it is no longer the
// rule that governs an ordinary "homeowner picked someone else" loss, so this
// file's exported name (kept for the many existing call sites) no longer
// literally matches what its string says. FIRST_APPLICATION_GUARANTEE below
// intentionally states the current, universal 0107 rule, not the legacy
// first-application-only one. Change 0107 (or, for the narrow stale-job
// backstop, 0044) and this file together.

// Says "lead credit" and "(not cash)" in the sentence itself, not just in the
// separate CREDIT_NOT_CASH_LINE below: a pro who reads this line alone (some
// surfaces render it without the follow-on line) should still never come away
// thinking a ghosted lead pays out to a card.

// monthly or yearly), and that cancels from inside the app any time with no
// penalty: src/app/pro/plus/actions.ts cancelProMembershipAction sets

// its term. Say only that; never claim there is no optional membership at

// and every other surface that shows the badge should say the same thing
// instead of a shorter, less accountable version of it. Takes the already-
// formatted date string (each caller formats its own timestamp, matching how

// already do it) rather than a raw ISO string, so this file never needs a
