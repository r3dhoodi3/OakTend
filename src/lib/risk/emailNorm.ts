// The cheapest way to farm a free trial without leaving your inbox is the plus
// tag and the gmail dot: sam@gmail.com, s.am@gmail.com, sam+1@gmail.com and
// sam+promo@gmail.com are four OakTend accounts and one human being. Every mail
// server involved delivers all four to the same person, so treating them as
// four separate first-time customers is a choice, not a fact.
//
// This module makes that one value. src/lib/risk/signals.ts hashes the result
// and stores it as an 'email_norm' signal, so a second account with a dotted or
// tagged variant of an existing address collides on the hash and the score sees
// it (+30 in src/lib/risk/score.ts).
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose: this is the piece most worth unit
// testing, and it has to behave identically at signup, at checkout, and in a
// test.

// Reduce an address to its canonical form. Returns null for anything that is
// not recognizably an email address, so callers can skip the signal entirely
// rather than storing a hash of garbage.
//
// The rules, and why each one is safe:
//
//   lowercase everything
//     The domain is case-insensitive by the spec. The local part technically
//     is not, but no mail provider anybody actually uses treats Sam@ and sam@
//     as different mailboxes, and treating them as different accounts here
//     would just hand a farmer a free variant.
//
//   strip the +tag, on every domain
//     Plus addressing is supported by Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Fastmail, Proton,
//     iCloud and most self-hosted setups. On a domain that does NOT support it,
//     the tagged address would simply not have received the confirmation email,
//     so it cannot be a real signed-up account in the first place. Stripping it
//     everywhere is therefore safe: at worst it merges two addresses that could
//     never both be live.
//
//   strip dots, on Gmail only
//     Dot-insensitivity is a Gmail-specific behaviour. Other providers really
//     do treat sam.smith@ and samsmith@ as different mailboxes, so stripping
//     dots there would merge two unrelated people into one account - a false
//     accusation, which is much worse than a missed one.
