// have been created or paid for from the same browser. It is not an analytics

// THE PROMOTION IS A SECURITY FIX, NOT A CONVENIENCE. This function used to
// return early whenever EITHER name was present, which meant a browser holding
// only the pre-rename cookie never got the new httpOnly one planted. The new
// name then stayed an empty slot that any page script could write with
// document.cookie - and every reader preferred the new name, so a page script
// could choose its own device id. Promoting the legacy VALUE under the new
// name (same httpOnly/secure/sameSite/path/maxAge as a fresh plant) and
// deleting the old name closes that window on the browser's very first
// request, which is why it runs on every path that reaches here, not only the
// funnel paths below.
//
// Called from src/middleware.ts AFTER updateSession has produced its response,
// so it applies to whatever that returned - a plain pass-through, a
// session-refreshed response, or a redirect to /signin. It never reads or
// changes the auth decision.
//
// Planted ONLY on the funnel paths above. The exclusions kept below (/api,
// /_next, file extensions, the metadata routes) are now redundant with the
// allowlist, but they stay as a cheap, obvious first gate: if the allowlist
// ever grows a broad entry, a Stripe webhook and a cached /robots.txt still
// never see a Set-Cookie.
//
// The whole body is wrapped in try/catch. This runs in the middleware, on every
// route in the matcher, so a throw here is not a lost signal - it is the entire
// site down. Returning the untouched response is always a correct answer:
// the worst case is one visitor with no device id, which the score already
// handles (it is one input among many, and its absence reads as "no link").
