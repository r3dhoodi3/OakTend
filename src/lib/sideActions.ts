// the moment either row exists, so it only ever serves someone who has built
// nothing yet (no side at all, or a stamp with nothing behind it). The
// difference here is that this action can only ever move someone to a side
// they demonstrably ALREADY HAVE (a contractors row, or a home), so it grants
// nothing: it only records which of their two existing sides they want to open
// on next time. Between the two, no path can hand an account a side it has not

  // homeowner side rather than being stamped onto a side it cannot open, which
  // is what would have made the trap survive the preview.
  //
  // /pros, the public coming-soon door with the waitlist form (William,
  // 2026-09-13): a homeowner who taps "Switch to your business" should be
  // told pros are coming soon AND be able to leave their email, not just get
  // a toast on the dashboard. In preview that page renders ProsComingSoon
  // with a "Go to your homeowner account" button for a signed-in viewer, so
  // it is a door with a way back, never a dead end. No flash: /pros is
  // outside the app shell, so a queued toast would only surface later, out
  // of context, on the next app page.
  //
  // An internal (OakTend team) account is let through, exactly as everywhere
  // else, so the team can still switch into a test company. Everyone else -
  // including a signed-in homeowner who just set up a business - lands on the
  // coming-soon door (restored 2026-09-19; "any signed-in account" let the
  // public in through homeowner signup). Outside preview
  // isProSideOpenForViewer() short-circuits on the flag, so this costs a
