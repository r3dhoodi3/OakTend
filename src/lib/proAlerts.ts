// contractor whose categories cover it AND who holds a live Pro membership gets
// pinged right away through sendNotification (in-app now, email/SMS too once
// the provider env vars are set). Free pros lose nothing: the job board and
// its realtime updates are untouched; members just don't have to watch it.
//
// COLD START: while COLD_START_FREE_ALERTS is on, the membership filter is
// skipped and EVERY category-matched contractor is alerted (state-matched
// where both sides have a state, mirroring 0046's null-safe locality rules).
// Flip the constant to restore members-only alerts; the membership path below
// stays intact behind it.
//
// Everything here is best-effort: any failure (missing table, migration lag,
// no matches) is logged and swallowed. Alerting must never break or slow the
// homeowner's posting flow.
//
// STILL ON THE BLOCKING PATH. The right answer is to run this after the
// response is sent, but Next 14 server actions have no after() - unstable_after
// arrives in Next 15 - and every alternative (a queue, a cron drain, an
// internal fetch to a route handler) is new infrastructure for a best-effort
// notifier. So the fix for now is to make it cheap rather than to move it:
// the fan-out below is batched down to two queries flat. Revisit as a Next 15
// follow-up, where wrapping the alertProsForNewLead() call site in after() is
// a one-line change and this file needs no edits at all.
