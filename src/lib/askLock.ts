// The Ask OakTend daily lock, remembered across mounts.
//
// The composer swaps for a locked bar the moment the server says the day's
// questions are spent, but that verdict only ever lived in component state:
// tapping away and coming back remounted the chat with an open composer that
// silently refuses everything typed into it. False hope, and the owner called
// it: "it doesn't allow you to enter a message, but can we just lock it".
//
// So the lock is written down. Keys are namespaced per user like the
// conversation itself (see AskOakTend.tsx), and per chat surface, so the
// homeowner chat and the pro copilot on one device never share a lock.
//
// WHEN IT LIFTS. The server's day is a fixed 24 hour window aligned to the
// epoch, not to local midnight (ASK_DAY_WINDOW_SECONDS in src/lib/aiUsage.ts,
// which is server-only and cannot be imported here), and no reply carries a
// reset timestamp, so the reset is computed exactly the same way: the next
// epoch-day boundary. Nothing here GATES anything - the server is still the
// only authority on the allowance. This only decides whether a composer that
// would be refused is shown as open.
