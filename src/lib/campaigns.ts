// Fixed vocabulary for the 2026-09 social launch's `/go/[code]` redirect
// (src/app/go/[code]/route.ts). See OakTend-marketing/growth/PRODUCTION-BRIEF.md
// item 1 and oaktend-audit/reports/social-growth-verify.md section 6 for the
// background: OakTend's analytics is first-party only (docs/ANALYTICS.md),
// and trackServerEvent (src/lib/trackServer.ts) inserts props RAW - it does
// not run sanitizeTrackProps the way the client /api/track route does. So a
// campaign code must never be written into app_events.props unless it came
// from a fixed, known-safe set: this file is that set.
//
// Shape check first, allowlist second. CAMPAIGN_CODE_RE is a cheap "is this
// even a plausible code" gate that decides 404 vs. a real lookup; it is NOT
// what makes a code safe to log. Only a code present in CAMPAIGN_CODES is
// ever written to app_events.props.code as itself - anything well-formed but
// not in the map redirects to "/" and is logged with the fixed literal
// "unknown_code" in place of the caller-supplied string, so a stranger
// probing /go/whatever-they-typed can never inject free text into analytics.
