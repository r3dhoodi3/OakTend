// ===========================================================================
// THE STAMPED-BUT-EMPTY ACCOUNT MUST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO CHANGE ITS MIND.
//
// A contractor-signup account whose company save keeps failing carries a
// "contractor" stamp and owns no row at all, so landingFor() sends every
// landing in the app to /pro/onboarding - correctly, since that is where its
// side gets built. The trap was that the two screens that could have let it
// out gated on the stamp too: /welcome/role redirected away whenever
// landingFor() returned anything but itself, and chooseRoleAction refused any
// account that already had a stamp. Sign-out and back in changed nothing,
// because none of it was session state.
//
// Both now gate on a ROW instead, which is the only thing that makes a side
// real, and /pro/onboarding carries its own way out. Source text for the same
// reason as the blocks above: every one of these compiles and looks right
// while doing the wrong thing.
