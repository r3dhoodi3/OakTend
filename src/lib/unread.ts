// suffix, trailing zero digits trimmed), while a JS `Date.toISOString()`
// value - which is what the "seen" cookie/localStorage timestamps are made
// of - always looks like "2026-08-27T12:00:00.123Z" (exactly 3 fractional
// digits, "Z" suffix). UnreadProvider.tsx and the homeowner chats page
// already avoid comparing these two formats with plain string `<`/`>` for
// exactly that reason; the pro chats page was the one holdout still doing
// `seenAt < lastMessageAt` as a raw string compare. Centralizing on epoch
// millis here removes the format mismatch as a variable entirely, so this
// class of bug can't reappear as the two pages' logic drifts apart.

// up (or silently misbehave) downstream, and on a server component that throw
// is a 500 on the whole inbox. So: parse, require a plain non-null,
// non-array object, and keep only the entries whose key AND value are both
// strings. Anything else reads as "nothing has been seen", which is the safe
// answer - the worst case is a thread showing as unread once.
