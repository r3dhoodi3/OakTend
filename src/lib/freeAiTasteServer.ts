// The database half of the free AI taste (see src/lib/freeAiTaste.ts for what
// the taste is and why). Service-role only, so it never ships to the browser.
//
// HOW A TASTE IS SPENT. Claimed ATOMICALLY up front through
// claim_free_ai_taste (migration 0135) and handed back through
// refund_free_ai_taste if the model call never produces a result. That
// ordering is deliberate, and it is the same trade the quote analyzer and the
// chat already make:
//
//  - Claiming up front is the only race-proof option. A check-then-increment
//    around a 60 second model call lets two tabs both pass the same check and
//    each spend a taste that was not there, which is a free account with no
//    limit at all if you can arrange it reliably.
//  - Refunding on failure is what keeps the promise the UI makes. A blurry
//    photo, a thrown request, or a ceiling above the caller must never burn a
//    taste, exactly like refundAskUsage / refundAiUsage in src/lib/aiUsage.ts.
//
// The net effect on the counter is identical to incrementing after a success;
// the difference is that the race window is closed rather than merely narrow.
//
// FAILS OPEN FOR EXACTLY ONE ERROR, and fails CLOSED for every other.
//
// The one: migration 0135 is not live yet, so the column and the function do
// not exist and every claim errors with a missing-schema shape
// (isMissingSchemaError in src/lib/dbErrors.ts - 42703/42P01/PGRST202/
// PGRST204/PGRST205 and their "not found in the schema cache" wording). Failing
// closed there would take a working, previously free feature away from every
// free account until someone pastes SQL, and would tell people they had spent
// a taste the database cannot prove they spent (the same reasoning as the FAIL
// OPEN in src/app/(app)/quote-check/page.tsx). That window is bounded: it shuts
// the moment the migration lands.
//
// Everything else - a timeout, a connection failure, a permission error, a
// future rename of the RPC - now REFUSES with the same 402 the routes already
// show at the paywall. A blip that silently disabled the gate forever, with a
// console.error nobody reads as the only symptom, was the actual risk here: it
// is the one failure mode that costs real money on the paid vision model and
// announces nothing. Cost is still additionally bounded by the per-user daily
// cap, the burst window, and the owner-wide spend breakers, all of which fail
// CLOSED as before.
//
// The fail-open is logged ONCE PER PROCESS at warn level, naming 0135, so a
// pending migration is one loud line at the top of the log rather than a
// console.error per request that reads like noise.

// How many tastes this account has left, for the meter only. Returns null for
// a Plus/trialing account (no meter is shown at all) and null when the counter
// cannot be read, in which case the UI shows nothing rather than a guess - the
// same posture askRemaining takes in src/lib/aiUsage.ts.
