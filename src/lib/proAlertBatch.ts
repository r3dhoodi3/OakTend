// Pure decision helpers for the batched job-post fan-out in

//
// They live in their own dependency-free module (no server-only, no Supabase,
// no next/*) for the same reason src/lib/notifyGating.ts does: the rules that
// decide who gets what are exactly the part worth unit testing, and importing
// proAlerts.ts from a test would drag in the service-role client and the
// "server-only" guard.
//
// THE SEMANTICS THESE MUST MATCH: sendNotification() in src/lib/notify.ts, on
// the single-recipient path. The fan-out replaces only its INSERT (one bulk
// insert for every recipient, instead of one query per recipient inside a
// server action the homeowner is waiting on); the email/SMS half still runs
// through notify.ts's own sendOutboundChannels(). What is restated here is the
// caller-side contact/opt-out shaping that proAlerts used to do inline, one
// user at a time, against a per-user read.

// The subset of a users row the fan-out reads for a recipient. All optional:
// a row can be missing entirely (deleted user, read that came back short), and
// notification_prefs is a jsonb column that may be null or shaped differently
// on an older database.
