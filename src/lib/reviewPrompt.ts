// Pure, DOM-light helpers for the "Enjoying OakTend?" review prompt
// (src/components/ReviewPrompt.tsx). Kept separate from the component so the
// trigger rules can be unit tested without rendering anything, and separate
// from src/app/(app)/feedback/actions.ts so the DB-backed signals it needs
// (settled, owed a follow-up, done something meaningful) stay server-only.
//
// The full gate for the "Enjoying OakTend?" card, in order, is:
//   1. not on an excluded page (onboarding, sign-in, checkout, /feedback itself)
//   2. not the first time this browser has ever loaded the app
//   3. the account has never settled the prompt (rated it, or answered
//      "Not really" and gone to the private feedback form)
//   4. the account has done something meaningful (claimed a home, posted a
//      job, asked Ask OakTend 3+ times, or a pro applied to one of its jobs)
//   5. this session was drawn as an "ask" session (see isAskSession)
//   6. they have actually been USING the app for the 15 to 20 minutes drawn
//      for this session (see advanceActiveTime), and have not been asked
//      already in this session
// (1), (2), (5) and (6) are decided here, client-side, for free. (3) and (4)
// come from the server (getReviewPromptSignals in feedback/actions.ts) because
// they depend on app_feedback, which this account cannot SELECT from directly
// (see migration 0133) - by design, so nobody can probe their own "have I been
// asked" state from the browser.
//
// WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY (2026-08-29): a 'prompt_shown' row used to settle the
// account forever, so one silent dismissal was the end of it, and tapping the
// store link counted as "rated" even though nobody had rated anything. Now
// only two things are permanent - an explicit "Yes, done" ('rated') and the
// negative branch ('not_really') - and everything else is a snooze that puts
// the card back into the session pool.
