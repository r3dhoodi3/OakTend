// Resolve the Stripe Price to bill an existing subscription with, for the Plus
// base plan and for the extra-home add-on.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The plan-switch actions used to build inline `price_data`
// carrying `product: <the product the subscription item already points at>`.
// That is the only shape a subscription-item update accepts (unlike Checkout,
// price_data there takes a product ID, not product_data), and it broke live:
// the "OakTend Plus" product backing the live subscriptions had been archived in
// the connected Stripe account, and Stripe refuses to attach a new price to an
// inactive product -
//
//   "The product prod_... is marked as inactive, and thus no new subscriptions
//    can be created to any plans of this product."
//
// so every "Switch to yearly" ended in the generic "something went sideways"
// flash and yearly could not be bought at all. Reusing a product id read off
// the subscription can never be safe: whether that product is still active is
// not something the app controls.
//
// So: never reference a product we did not just prove is active. Find an active
// product tagged with our own metadata, create one if there isn't one (or if
// the only one is archived), then find-or-create an active recurring price on
// it at the exact amount and interval we mean to charge. Both lookups are
// keyed so a second call reuses what the first created instead of littering the
// account with duplicates.
//
// Setting STRIPE_PRICE_PLUS_WEEKLY / _MONTHLY / _YEARLY (and
// STRIPE_PRICE_HOME_SLOT_MONTHLY / _YEARLY) is still the cleanest setup - a
// price you created and can see in the dashboard beats one this file minted -
// and an env value always wins here. This is the fallback that has to work
// anyway, because it is what runs when the env var is missing, which is exactly
// the state live was in.
