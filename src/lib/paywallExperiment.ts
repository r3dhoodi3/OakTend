// The soft-vs-hard paywall experiment (owner ask, 2026-08-30): some accounts
// are offered the 3-day free trial on every paywall ("soft"), the rest see the
// same paywalls with no trial mentioned anywhere and a checkout that charges
// from day one ("hard"), so the two conversion rates can be compared.
//
// ASSIGNMENT IS DETERMINISTIC AND PER ACCOUNT. The variant is a pure hash of
// the user id plus a literal salt, so the same account lands on the same
// variant on every render, every device, and every deploy, with no database
// column and no cookie to drift. There is deliberately no per-render
// randomness: a paywall that flips between "3 days free" and "charged today"
// on reload would be both useless data and a ROSCA problem, since the
// disclosure the buyer consents to must match what checkout does.
//
// THE VARIANT NEVER WIDENS ELIGIBILITY. "hard" is only ever one more reason a
// trial does not apply, ANDed in next to the existing checks
// (isPlusTrialEligible / isProTrialEligible and the risk decision), which stay
// exactly as they are. An account with any subscription history was never
// trial-eligible on either variant, so existing trialing and paid members are
// unaffected either way.
//
// ENDING THE EXPERIMENT. Set the PAYWALL_EXPERIMENT env var and redeploy:
//   PAYWALL_EXPERIMENT=soft   every account sees the trial offer (today's
//                             behavior before the experiment)
//   PAYWALL_EXPERIMENT=hard   no account sees a trial offer
//   PAYWALL_EXPERIMENT=split  the 50/50 hash split (also the default when the
//                             var is unset or carries any other value)
// The override is read on every call, so no code change is needed to end the
// test - pick the winner, set the var, redeploy.

export type PaywallVariant = "soft" | "hard";

// A literal experiment salt, never reused for anything else. Changing it would
// silently reshuffle every account between the two arms mid-experiment and
// corrupt the comparison, so it stays fixed for the life of this test.
//
// BRAND RENAME EXCEPTION (2026-09-12): this string is deliberately left
// spelling the pre-rename brand name. It is an opaque hash input, never
// displayed, never read for its meaning - only for producing the same 50/50
// split it has produced since 2026-08-30. Editing it, even to fix the brand
// name, IS the exact failure mode the comment above warns about: every
// account would land in a new arm mid-experiment. Leave it exactly as-is
// until the experiment ends (see the module comment's "ENDING THE
// EXPERIMENT" section), then delete this constant entirely rather than
// renaming it.
