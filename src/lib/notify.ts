// Single entry point for notifying a homeowner. Always writes the in-app
// notification row (what the bell in the nav shows), then tries the push,
// email and SMS channels - all three stay dormant until their env vars exist,
// so wiring one up later is just adding keys, no code changes.
//
// One caller does NOT come through the front door: the job-post fan-out in
// src/lib/proAlerts.ts writes its in-app rows in a single bulk insert (one
// query for up to MAX_ALERTS pros instead of one per pro, inside a server
// action the homeowner is waiting on) and then calls sendOutboundChannels
// below for the email/SMS half. That is the ONLY thing it reimplements - the
// insert - so the Plus gate, the email opt-out, and the TCPA/quiet-hours rules
// still live here and here only. Anything added to sendNotification after the
// insert must go inside sendOutboundChannels, or the fan-out will not get it.
// The marketing budget check below is the one exception that is safe to leave
// out of sendOutboundChannels: the fan-out only ever sends "new_lead", which
// is on the TRANSACTIONAL_NOTIFICATION_KINDS allowlist and would pass the
// check unconditionally anyway. A future fan-out kind that is NOT
// transactional would need the check added to sendOutboundChannels too.
//
// OakTend Plus gate: for the proactive homeowner alert/reminder kinds listed in
// src/lib/notifyGating.ts, the email and SMS channels are a paid perk. The
// in-app row is still written for everyone, and so is the web push (free to
// send, so nothing to gate); only email and SMS are withheld. See
// sendNotification below - the check lives there so no cron can skip it.
//
// Marketing frequency cap: BEFORE any of that, and before the in-app row is
// even written, sendNotification checks withinMarketingBudget for every kind
// not on the TRANSACTIONAL_NOTIFICATION_KINDS allowlist in
// src/lib/notifyGating.ts. At most MARKETING_BUDGET_MAX_PER_WINDOW
// non-transactional notifications reach one person per rolling
// MARKETING_BUDGET_WINDOW_DAYS, counted across every campaign kind together.
// See docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md for the full kind list and how to add a
// campaign.
//
// To activate push: generate a VAPID key pair and set
//   NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_SUBJECT
// See src/lib/push.ts and docs/GO-LIVE-WIRING.md.
// To activate email: create a Resend account (resend.com) and set
//   RESEND_API_KEY - from resend.com/api-keys
//   RESEND_FROM    - a verified sender, e.g. "OakTend <hello@yourdomain.com>"
// To activate SMS: create a Twilio account (twilio.com) and set
//   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER
//
// TCPA gate: SMS is a strictly opt-in channel (statutory damages of $500-1500
// PER TEXT for sending without consent, per user_id.sms_consent - migration
// 0073). sendSms requires smsConsent === true in addition to the env vars and
// a phone number; any other value (undefined, false, null) is treated as "no
// consent on file" and the text is skipped. Callers must read sms_consent off
// the users row themselves and pass it through - this module never queries
// the DB for it, so a caller that forgets to pass it simply gets no SMS
