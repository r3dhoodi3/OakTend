// anywhere reads it back, is the write-only assessor bookkeeping:
//   parcel_id, ownership_owner_names, ownership_owner_type,
//   ownership_owner_occupied  - written by record_ownership_check / onboarding
//   ownership_verified        - self-attested MVP flag, superseded by
//                               ownership_status and marked dead in
//                               src/app/onboarding/actions.ts
//   property_type              - written at onboarding, never read off a
//                               property row (the onboarding form reads it
//                               off the parcel lookup, not the DB row)
// lot_size_sqft used to be in that same "write-only" group, but the
// home-details editor (src/app/(app)/home-details/page.tsx) now prefills its
// form from this row, so it has to stay in the select below.
// ownership_owner_names in particular is an unbounded json blob carried on
// every home on every app page.
// Whether this process has already learned that properties.unit (migration
// 0127) does not exist on the live database.
//
// The column name alone makes Postgres reject the WHOLE select with 42703, and
// the fallback below catches that and retries with select("*"). Correct, but
// paid on EVERY request until someone runs the migration: a failed query plus
// a retry, forever, for a column the database has already told us it does not
// have. Remembering the answer turns that into one failed query per process.
//
// A TTL, not a permanent flag. The answer is only ever set one way, toward
// "missing", and it is only ever learned from a real failed query, so it can
// never be set optimistically. But it goes STALE in one direction that
// matters: the moment 0127 is applied, every process that has already learned
// "missing" keeps dropping `unit` from its projection until it restarts. On a
// long-lived server that is indefinitely, and the symptom is silent - a condo
// owner's address renders without their unit number and nothing errors, so
// nobody reports it. Ten minutes is short enough that applying the migration
// heals itself without a deploy, and long enough that the failed-query-plus-
// retry it exists to avoid is paid at most six times an hour per process.
//
// A stale "missing" costs nothing but the unit line (formatAddressLine treats
// a dropped column exactly like a null unit); a stale "present" costs one
// failed query and one retry, which is the behaviour this cache replaced. Both
// directions are safe, which is why an expiry is affordable here at all.
