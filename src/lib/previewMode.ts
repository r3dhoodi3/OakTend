// The homeowner-preview switch, and the two copy strings every gated surface
// shows.
//
// WHAT PREVIEW MODE IS. Until the lawyer review lands, OakTend ships as a
// homeowner-only product: every homeowner feature is on and free, nothing
// anywhere can be paid for, and the contractor side is closed behind a
// "coming soon" page. When the review is done the whole thing flips back with
// one environment variable and a redeploy - there is no code change and no
// database change on the way back.
//
// NO "server-only" HERE, DELIBERATELY. Client components (the preview banner,
// the two native IAP screens) and vitest both import this, so it has to stay a
// plain module with no Node-only dependency. Everything that needs the admin
// client or a session lives in src/lib/previewModeServer.ts instead.
//
// NEXT_PUBLIC_, DELIBERATELY. A client component cannot read a private env
// var, and the banner and the native checkout screens are client components.
// The value is not a secret: it says "we are in preview", which every visitor
// can already see from the banner.
//
// READ AT CALL TIME, NOT AT MODULE LOAD. `const ON = process.env... === ...`
// at the top of this file would be evaluated once, when the module is first
// imported, which makes it impossible for a test to flip with vi.stubEnv and
// impossible for a dev server to pick up a changed .env.local without a
// restart. The function body re-reads the variable on every call; it is a
// string comparison, so the cost is nothing.
//
// EXACT-MATCH ON "homeowner", NOT A TRUTHINESS CHECK. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE=false`
// or `=off` is a thing a person genuinely types when they mean "off", and a
// truthy check would read both as ON and close the contractor side of a live
// site. Only the one documented value turns this on; unset, empty, misspelled
// or anything else is normal behaviour.
