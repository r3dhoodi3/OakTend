// When to ask somebody to turn on phone notifications, and how to remember
// that we asked.
//
// The rule this file exists to enforce: NEVER ask cold. A browser only gives
// out notification permission once - a "no" is close to permanent, and it can
// only be undone in browser settings that most people never open. So the ask
// has to land right after a moment that makes it obvious why: a job just
// posted, a message just arrived. Asking on page load, before anything has
// happened, is how a feature gets denied forever on the first day.
//
// All state is localStorage, keyed per account, and every read and write is
// wrapped: a browser with storage disabled simply never shows the prompt,
// which is the safe direction.

// Set by markPushMoment() when something worth being notified about just
// happened. Not per user: the moment is a property of this browser tab right
// now, and the per-user keys below are what decide whether to act on it.
