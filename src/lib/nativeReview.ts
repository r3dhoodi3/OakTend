// The platform adapter for the OS's own "rate this app" sheet, plus the tiny
// event bus that tells the app a good moment to ask has just happened.
//
// WEB TODAY: every function here is a no-op or a plain flag. Nothing in this
// file imports a Capacitor package. UPDATE (2026-09-07, appstore-execute):
// the Capacitor native app shell now exists (capacitor.config.ts, ios/,
// android/ - see docs/APP-STORE-SUBMISSION.md), but
// @capacitor-community/in-app-review specifically was not one of the plugins
// that pass installed (it was out of scope for that checklist), so this file
// is still deliberately unfinished rather than half-wired: adding the static
// import below without the package present would break the build, and this
// file's own review test (src/lib/reviewPrompt.test.ts) still asserts no
// static Capacitor import here for exactly that reason.
//
// TO FINISH THIS: install @capacitor-community/in-app-review (or
// @capawesome/capacitor-app-review) and fill in requestPlatformReview():
//
//   import { Capacitor } from "@capacitor/core";
//   import { InAppReview } from "@capacitor-community/in-app-review";
//   export async function requestPlatformReview(): Promise<void> {
//     if (!Capacitor.isNativePlatform()) return;
//     try { await InAppReview.requestReview(); } catch { /* never surface */ }
//   }
//
// WHAT THE OS DOES WITH THE CALL, and why nothing here returns anything
// useful:
//   - iOS shows its own sheet at most 3 times per person per 365 days, per
//     app, across all versions. Calls past that are silently ignored.
//   - It reports NOTHING back: not whether the sheet appeared, not whether a
//     rating was left, not what the rating was. There is no callback, ever.
//   - A person can turn it off entirely (Settings > App Store > In-App Ratings
//     and Reviews), and TestFlight builds never show it. Both are silent.
//   - Google Play's equivalent has an undocumented, changeable quota and the
//     same silence.
// So: never branch any UI on this resolving, never show a spinner over it, and
// never tell somebody "thanks for rating" because of it.

// The positive outcomes that earn an ask. Deliberately short: "has done
// anything at all" is not a moment, it is a pulse.
//   job_hired   wired, src/app/(app)/contractors/HireAgainButton.tsx.
//   plan_built  NOT wired yet. generateMaintenancePlanAction
//               (src/app/(app)/dashboard/actions.ts) is a server action posted
//               from a plain <form> in the dashboard server component, so
//               there is no client success state to call this from. It needs a
//               small client component mounted on the dashboard that fires
//               reportReviewMoment("plan_built") once the "Your maintenance
//               plan is ready" state renders. Left undone on purpose: the
//               dashboard page was being rewritten in the same session.
// A third trigger the owner may want later, a positive in-app feedback score,
// has nothing to hang off yet: no thumbs/stars surface exists anywhere in the
// app. Build that first, then add its moment here.
