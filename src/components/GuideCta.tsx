// Shared closing CTA for the public /guides pages. Every guide page ends with
// the same pitch: the ranges above are national/typical, OakTend's answer is
// specific to the visitor's own home, and it's free to get. Keep this in
// lockstep across all guide pages rather than letting each page drift.
//
// Session-aware: a signed-in visitor with an account has already gotten
// past this pitch, so repeating "get started free" reads as a bug, not a
// nudge.
//
// NOW A CLIENT COMPONENT, and that is the whole point. This used to answer the
// session question on the server - first with its own supabase.auth.getUser()
// call, later through the request-cached getVerifiedUser() it shared with
// src/app/guides/layout.tsx. Either way it was a server-side session read
// sitting in the tree of 14 public, indexable pages, which is what kept every
// one of them off static generation. It now reads the session in the browser
// through useSignedIn() (see src/components/SessionCta.tsx for the full
// reasoning and the honest cost), so the guide BODY prerenders and only this
// closing card resolves after hydration - which is exactly the fix the old
// comment here and in the guides layout both asked for.
//
// It renders the signed-out pitch first and swaps, so a signed-in reader sees
// the sign-up card for a moment. It sits at the foot of a long article, well
// below the fold, so the swap is not something a reader watches happen.
//
// signedIn: pass it when the calling tree already knows the answer for its own
// reasons and wants to skip the client lookup entirely. Nothing passes it
// today; the /guides pages and the city pages all rely on the hook.
//
// signedInHref/signedInLabel let a page point a signed-in reader at the
// in-app screen that answers the same question for their own home. Callers
// that don't pass them get "/", which routes by side - a contractor reading a
// guide lands on their own shell instead of a homeowner dashboard they do not
// have.
