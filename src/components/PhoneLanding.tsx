// The phone landing: everything a visitor who already downloaded the app
// needs, plus just enough substance that the screen does not read as empty.
//
// Someone arriving here on a phone came from the App Store listing or from a
// friend's link. They may be a homeowner or a contractor, so the screen shows
// a warm hero photo for life, then two role doors (homeowner signup,
// contractor signup), then a quieter sign-in for people who already have an
// account, then three one-line reasons to walk through a door. Every marketing
// section on the landing page is
// hidden below `sm` instead (`max-sm:hidden` on each section wrapper in
// src/app/page.tsx) - hidden, not deleted, so desktop is byte-identical and
// the copy still gets indexed.
//
// The tour that used to live on the landing page ("How it works", "What
// OakTend watches for you") is now the post-login guide, src/components/
// AppGuide.tsx, which is where it actually helps.
//
// SIZING: a hero photo (the same HERO_PHOTOS the desktop cycler uses, passed
// in as a prop) sits under the headline to give the phone screen a visual
// anchor - without it the page was just text on a flat fill and read as empty.
// The photo's aspect-[3/2] frame is ~225px tall at phone width, so the two
// role doors sit a little lower than before but still clear the fold on a
// 390x844 phone; only the benefit rows and the quiet row fall below it. Keep
// the doors above the fold - they are the point.
//
// The doors stay single-line on purpose: .btn (globals.css) is a row flex
// tuned to center a single line inside its 44px minimum, and a sub-line
// would need a nested column span plus extra height the fold budget does
// not have. The benefit rows carry the extra words instead.
//
// `sm:hidden` on the wrapper is the counterpart to the `max-sm:hidden` marks
// in page.tsx: exactly one of the two landings renders at any width, and the
// desktop one is untouched.

// One-line benefit rows. Icons are drawn to match Logo.tsx: 24-box viewBox,
// stroke currentColor at 1.8, round caps and joins, no fill.
