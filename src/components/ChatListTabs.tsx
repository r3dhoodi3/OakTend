// server-resolved or plain-data <li> elements), so switching tabs is a pure
// client toggle: no new queries, no navigation, instant.
//
// The segmented track copies the idiom from src/app/(app)/account/
// AccountTabs.tsx: a stone-100 rounded-xl track with p-1, the on tab lifted
// on white with a small shadow, 44px targets on a phone via min-h-11 that
// collapse to the compact desktop height from sm up.
//
// The tab deliberately resets to Active on every visit rather than being
// remembered in storage. The one exception is initialTab: when the thread the
// URL opens with is already a finished one, starting on Closed keeps that
// conversation visible and highlighted in the list beside it.
