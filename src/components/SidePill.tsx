// Quiet "which side am I on" indicator for the header. Rendered only for
// accounts that hold BOTH a homeowner and a pro side - Nav.tsx passes it only
// when hasPro is true, ProNav.tsx only when hasHome is true, so a single-side
// account sees nothing new here. One accent color, no gradient, matching the
// flat-color design rule; the accent follows the token the calling nav
// already uses (bark for both Nav.tsx and ProNav.tsx now; the ember "oaktend"
// option has no caller) so this never introduces a third brand color.
//
// `label` is a free string: usually a short side name ("Home" / "Business"),
// but the pro phone header passes the company name here, so callers that do
// that should pass a max-width + `truncate` via className to keep it tidy.
