// The membership nudge on the pro Home tab. Small, honest, and dismissable.

// THE RULE IT ENFORCES. Dismissing hides it for the rest of the DAY, not for
// the rest of the page view: the owner asked for "a little annoying", and the
// line between that and hostile is whether "not now" is respected for a
// meaningful stretch. So the stamp is an epoch day number per user, and the
// card comes back tomorrow rather than on the next navigation.
//
// It is deliberately NOT rendered on any screen where a pro is mid-task (the
// apply flow, a chat, onboarding, the billing form). The Home tab is the one
// place it mounts, and the server decides whether to mount it at all: only for
// an established non-member (see isEstablishedPro), never for a member.
//
// Hidden until the stamp has been read, so a dismissed card never flashes on
// screen before the effect can hide it. localStorage failures (private mode,
// storage disabled) fall through to showing the card, which is the safe
// direction: a nudge nobody can dismiss permanently is still just one card.
