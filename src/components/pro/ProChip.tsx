// The pro-side twin of the homeowner dashboard's PlusChip: a small "Pro" token
// on a tile or button that an OakTend Pro membership unlocks, so a non-member
// sees what is behind the wall BEFORE tapping instead of after. Same shape and
// size as PlusChip, in the OakTend accent the pro shell uses rather than bark.
//
// It marks a door, it never blocks one. Nothing a pro owns (their leads, their
// jobs, their money, their messages) ever wears this.
//
// tone="free" (2026-08-30): a second, green-toned reading for a door that is
// NOT actually member-only, such as the Estimate tile once every contractor
// got two free drafts (0145) - the oaktend-accent "Pro" tone would claim a gate
// that no longer exists there, which is exactly the lie CEO pass item C asked
// to stop telling. Same shape, different color and (usually) different label.
