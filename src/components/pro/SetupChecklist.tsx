// "use client" is a STREAMING fix, not a behaviour one. This component has no
// state, no effects and no browser APIs; it would work perfectly well as a
// server component, and it was one until 2026-08-30.
//
// The reason it moved: React Flight defers any element it meets once the row
// it is serializing has passed a byte budget (`3200 < serializedSize ->
// deferTask` in react-server-dom-webpack-server). The pro Home tab renders
// this checklist LAST, so on /pro the budget ran out right inside the <ul>
// and every remaining <li> was chopped into its own Flight row. SSR then
// suspends on each of those rows and emits an out-of-order stream segment for
// it, which is a `<template id="P:n">` hole in the flushed markup plus a late
// `<script>$RS(...)</script>` to fill it: eight of them on /pro, against the
// single one every healthy pro page has. That chain is the one structural
// difference between the pro pages that throw a hydration error on load
// (/pro, /pro/leads) and the ones that never do (/pro/help, /pro/chats,
// /pro/profile, /pro/crm, /pro/business), and when hydration does give up,
// every one of those late $RS calls then fails too ("Cannot read properties
// of null") because React has already removed the nodes they address.
//
// As a client component the checklist is a single client reference in the
// payload and its items are plain data, so there are no elements left at the
// tail of the row for Flight to defer. Measured on the local production build
// against the same account: /pro went from 8 `<template id="P:">` holes and 8
// $RS scripts to 1 and 1 - the same shape as the pro pages that were always
// clean - and the document shrank by 6.2 kB.
//
// Keep it a client component. If it ever needs server-only data, pass that in
// as a prop rather than moving the markup back across the boundary.
