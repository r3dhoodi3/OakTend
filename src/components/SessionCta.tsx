// The session-aware CTA for the PUBLIC marketing pages, resolved in the
// browser instead of on the server.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. /guides (the index plus 12 guide pages), /fountain-valley
// and /huntington-beach are the pages Google actually sends traffic to, and
// every one of them was rendered per-request purely because a server component
// read the session to decide whether the header said "Get started free" or
// "Open your dashboard". A layout's dynamic read opts its whole subtree out of
// static generation, so one auth round trip in src/app/guides/layout.tsx cost
// 13 pages their prerender and put a network hop to Supabase's auth server in
// front of the guide's own content. Both files' comments already named this
// component as the fix and asked for it in its own pass. This is that pass.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, HONESTLY. A signed-in reader sees the signed-out CTA for the
// few milliseconds between paint and hydration, then it swaps. That is the
// trade the old comments were unwilling to make while the swap was the only
// change; it is worth making now that the whole page ships from the CDN
// instead of a cold serverless invocation. The swap is contained: the header
// button is the last item in a `justify-between` row, so only its own width
// changes and nothing else on the page moves.
//
// HOW IT READS THE SESSION. The browser Supabase client
// (@supabase/ssr's createBrowserClient) reads the same auth cookie the server
// client writes, so getSession() answers locally with no request of its own -
// no /api/session route, no fetch waterfall, nothing for the CDN to vary on.
// If it cannot answer (cleared storage, a cookie the browser refused), the
// answer is "signed out", which is the same thing every anonymous visitor
// sees. That is the right way to be wrong here: the worst case is showing a
// signed-in reader the sign-up link, which still works for them.
//
// This is presentation only. It decides which of two public links to render
// and reads nothing sensitive. No page gate, no data access, and no server
// route trusts it.
