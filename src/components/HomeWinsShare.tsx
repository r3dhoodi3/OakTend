// Home Wins feature - remove this file to remove the in-app surface.
//
// A small, dismissible "Share your home wins" card for the dashboard. Shows the
// homeowner their own positive wins (computed server-side by
// src/lib/homeWins.ts and passed in), then lets them share them: the public
// wins card image (src/app/api/wins-card/[code]/route.tsx) is shown as a
// live PREVIEW (the exact image that gets posted, with a skeleton while it
// loads), then fetched and shared as an actual FILE through the Web Share
// API where the platform accepts files (iMessage, Instagram, Photos, etc),
// so the recipient gets the real picture instead of a bare link. Falls back
// to a link-only native share, then to copying the caption and link, then
// to showing them as selectable text. A quiet "Download the image" link
// exists ONLY where file sharing is unavailable (desktop browsers): on a
// phone the OS share sheet already offers Save Image, so a second download
// control there would be clutter. The referral link (?ref=CODE) rides
// along in every path so the share and the acquisition attribution always
// use the SAME code.
//
// The file-share attempt mirrors ReviewButton.tsx's CR4#2 photo share
// exactly: gate on navigator.canShare being a function before ever fetching
// bytes, build a File from the fetched Blob, and only hand it to
// navigator.share once canShare({ files }) itself says yes.
//
// Reuses the exact clipboard/share/localStorage patterns already proven in
// InviteNeighbor.tsx and ReviewShareRow.tsx. No reward is promised anywhere.
