//
// Scoping: every poll resolves the side's own lead ids through the shared
// myLeadIdsForRole helper (src/lib/sideLeads.ts) and adds
// `.in("lead_id", ...)` to the messages query. Relying on RLS plus
// `.neq("sender_role", role)` alone was the reported fake-toast bug: a
// dual-role (homeowner + pro) account can read messages on BOTH sides' leads,
// so its own outgoing business messages toasted as "Your pro" on the
// homeowner side, and incoming homeowner-side messages toasted on the pro
// side with wrong links - the same failure class the unread badge already
// fixed in UnreadProvider, now funneled through the one helper.
//
// It also carries the two Web Push mounts (PushRegistrar, PushPrompt) and the
// Web Vitals reporter (WebVitals), because it is the one component both
// shells already render for both roles - so push and perf reporting reach
// homeowners and pros without a second mount point in either root layout.
// This poller is ALSO the honest moment to ask about push: a toast for a
// message that arrived while the app was open is exactly the thing the person
// would have missed with the app closed.
