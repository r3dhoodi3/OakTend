  // Ask OakTend briefly had a tab of its own here, which made five tabs on a
  // 390px screen and gave the assistant a top-level home it doesn't need. It
  // lives inside Messages instead - a pinned conversation at the top of /chats
  // that opens the full-screen /ask view (see AskOakTendRow), with NavLinks
  // treating /ask as a child of Messages so the tab stays lit while you're in
  // there. There is no floating pill any more, at any width: Messages is the
  // only door.
  //
  // THE SHELL BREAKPOINT IS `lg`, NOT `sm` (changed 2026-08-30). The top strip
  // used to switch on at sm (640px) but only had room for itself from about
  // 1024px up, so between those two widths the nav pills painted straight over
  // the "OakTend" wordmark and the home address. Everything that used to say
  // "below sm the tab bar exists" now says "below lg". Desktop at 1024px and
  // up is unchanged; tablets get the phone-style bottom bar instead of a
  // colliding top strip.
