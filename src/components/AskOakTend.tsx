 * Which conversation the next question should be appended to: the one held in

 * Normally they are the same list and memory wins, because memory is the only
 * one that is up to date the instant something changes. But memory lives in a
 * ref, and a ref is the one piece of state React cannot re-derive: anything
 * that leaves it behind - a render that ran with older state, a stale closure,
 * a storage read that lost a race - takes turns off the front of the next
 * request, and the reader watches a finished answer vanish from the transcript
 * the moment they ask their next question.
 *
 * So: when the saved conversation contains everything memory has AND MORE, the
 * saved one wins. That shape has exactly one cause - memory fell behind - and
 * it is the shape the reported bug leaves. A saved list that is shorter, or
 * that disagrees about a message memory already has, is left alone: that is
 * another instance of this chat clearing or deleting, which memory is right to
 * have followed.
