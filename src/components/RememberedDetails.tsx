// closed it themselves. The owner's rule: "as long as they don't manually
// close it, it stays open" - open on the first visit and on the thousandth.
//
// Why the open state is not a React state value: the server renders the
// element with `open` so the content is there for the very first paint and for
// a no-JS render, and a remembered close is applied in useLayoutEffect (before
// paint, so it never flashes open then snaps shut). Rendering `open` from
// state would either mismatch hydration or need a two-pass render.
//
// The remembered flag lives in localStorage under a key namespaced by user id,
// same shape as SeasonalChecklist's per-period keys: it is a per-device UI
// preference, not data worth a round trip.
