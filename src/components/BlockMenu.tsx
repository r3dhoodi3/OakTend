// The Block control. A small overflow menu rather than a bare button, because
// blocking sits next to Report and neither deserves to be the loudest thing on
// a chat header or a business page.
//
// Three steps on purpose: menu, confirm, done. Blocking is not reversible from
// the surface you did it on - once a thread is blocked the pro's board no
// longer shows that homeowner - so the confirm step is the difference between
// a deliberate action and a mis-tap on a phone. The undo lives on the blocked
// list page, and the "done" state links straight to it so nobody has to go
// hunting for it.
//
// The form never says WHO to block. It passes the lead or the contractor
// profile this menu was rendered on, and the server action resolves the other
// party from it. See src/app/(app)/account/blocks/actions.ts.
//
// WHAT THE CONFIRM STEP HAS TO SAY, and why it is worth the extra lines. A
// block stops NEW contact: the other account cannot message you, cannot apply
// to jobs you post from now on, and the two of you stop being shown to each
// other. It does NOT touch a job or a conversation that already exists -
// migration 0138's guard sits on message INSERT and on apply_to_lead, not on
// can_access_lead, so a pro blocked mid-job still opens the thread they are
// already assigned to and still sees what that lead exposed to them. The old
// copy implied more than the enforcement delivers, which is the worst way for
// someone to find out. So the confirm step says it plainly, and where the
// surrounding screen already has the control that DOES end the thing
// (LeadChat's "End" in the conversation header), it is offered right here
// rather than left to be hunted for.
