// The client half of the flash-toast system, and the reason the root layout is
// allowed to be static.
//
// ARCHITECTURE (unchanged contract, moved render):
//   SETS    - setFlash() in a Server Action, src/lib/flash.ts. Writes a
//             short-lived, non-httpOnly cookie that survives the action's
//             revalidatePath()/redirect().
//   RENDERS - this component, on the client, by reading document.cookie.
//   DELETES - this component, right after the toast is queued, so a refresh
//             cannot replay it.
//
// This used to be FlashBridge: the root layout called readFlash() (which calls
// cookies()) and handed the result down as a prop. That one cookies() read made
// EVERY route in the app dynamic, because the root layout wraps every page - the
// build produced zero static pages. The cookie was already httpOnly: false
// precisely so the client could clear it, so the client can read it just as
// easily, and nothing about the setFlash/readFlash server contract changes.
// readFlash() stays exported for any server consumer that wants it.
//
// The cookie name is duplicated here as a literal rather than imported from
// src/lib/flash.ts on purpose: that module imports next/headers, which must
// never be pulled into the browser bundle. Keep the two in lockstep.
