// The header "take a tour" button, top-right of both shells (Nav.tsx and
// ProNav.tsx). The first-run spotlight tour only auto-opens once per account
// (AppGuide stamps guide_seen_at / pro_guide_seen_at and mirrors it in
// localStorage), so once somebody has been through it there was no visible way
// back in except the "Show the app guide again" link buried on the help pages.
// This button is that same replay, promoted to the header: it dispatches the
// window event AppGuideMount is already listening for in both signed-in shells,
// which reopens the tour in place - no navigation, no refetch - regardless of
// the seen stamp, exactly as ShowAppGuideButton does.
//
// Icon-only to match the other header controls (search, bell), with an
// accessible name. Both shells use the bark accent (the pro side dropped the
// ember red), so the two entries below are the same on purpose.
//
// Hover is the -100 shade, not -50: the headers themselves are bark-50, so a
// -50 hover was the header's own colour and read as dead.
