// loads it as its own chunk after hydration instead of shipping and
// hydrating the whole choreography engine for every visitor.
//
// ssr: false is client-only, and src/app/pros/page.tsx is a server component,
// hence this wrapper. The loading state reuses the player's own poster markup
// and CSS module, so the 16/9 box is reserved from the first paint.
