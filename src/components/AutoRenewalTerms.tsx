// The auto-renewal disclosure block, rendered directly above the button that
// starts a subscription checkout on both plan toggles.
//
// Placement is the point. ROSCA (15 U.S.C. 8403(1)) wants all material terms
// disclosed "before obtaining the consumer's billing information", and
// California's Automatic Renewal Law (Bus. & Prof. Code 17602(a)(1)) wants
// them "in visual proximity ... to the request for consent". Sitting inside
// the same form as the submit button, immediately above it, satisfies both
// readings; moving it into a footer, a tooltip, or behind a link would not.
//
// It is also deliberately plain: 17602(a)(4) forbids surrounding the consent
// with information that "interferes with, detracts from, contradicts, or
// otherwise undermines" it, so there is no marketing copy, no countdown, and
// no competing call to action inside this block.
//
// PHONE TYPE SIZE. Every line here is text-xs (12px) from sm up, which is the
// established look, but 12px is below the readable floor on a phone and this
// is the block a buyer is legally entitled to actually read. Each one carries
// max-sm:text-sm so it lands at 14px below sm; sm and up is byte-identical.
// `variant` switches the same three facts between the two moments they are
// legally required. "checkout" is the pre-purchase disclosure; "acknowledgment"
// is the post-purchase one California requires under 17602(a)(3), which has to
// carry the renewal terms, the cancellation policy, and how to cancel.
