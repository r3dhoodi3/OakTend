// Shared shell for the two city landing pages (src/app/fountain-valley,
// src/app/huntington-beach): same structure and same value-prop cards, only
// the housing-stock paragraph and city name differ. Kept as one component
// rather than duplicated JSX so the two pages can't drift out of sync, the
// same way GuideCta is shared across the /guides pages.
//
// Schema.org: Service, not LocalBusiness. OakTend is an online service with
// no physical storefront in either city (the pros it connects homeowners to
// are the local businesses); claiming LocalBusiness here would be the same
// kind of overreach the /p/[id] pro pages explicitly avoid for a pro's own
// site. Service + areaServed is the honest match for "software available to
// homeowners in this city."
//
// Session-aware header/hero CTA: same reasoning as src/app/guides/layout.tsx
// - a signed-in visitor shouldn't be pitched "get started free" again.
//
// BOTH CITY PAGES ARE NOW STATIC. This component used to call
// supabase.auth.getUser() here, and <GuideCta /> below read the session again,
// which is what kept /fountain-valley and /huntington-beach off static
// generation. The old note in this spot named the fix - "a small client
// component that resolves the session in the browser and renders the CTA, used
// here and in GuideCta" - and that component now exists
// (src/components/SessionCta.tsx, which GuideCta shares). Both CTAs below are
// it, nothing in this tree reads cookies() or the session, and the two pages
// carry `export const revalidate`.
//
// The trade, stated plainly and argued in SessionCta.tsx: a signed-in visitor
// sees "Get started free" until hydration swaps it. In exchange these two
// pages ship from the CDN instead of waking a serverless function and waiting
// on a Supabase auth round trip before the first byte.
