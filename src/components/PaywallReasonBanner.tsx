// nor the tool pages that link here can do on their own:
//
//  1. Remember the reason in LAST_REASON_COOKIE so the dashboard can lead
//     with the matching tool tile on the next visit (PLAN A1#2).
//  2. Cap how many DISTINCT reasons get a banner in one session - a
//     homeowner who bounces off four different paywalls in one visit sees
//     the sales line on the first three only. The underlying gate (job
//     posting blocked, tool locked, quote credit spent) is unaffected either
//     way; only this banner's text stands down (PLAN A1#3).
//
// Starts visible - the children arrived in the server-rendered HTML already -
// and only ever HIDES after the mount check runs, never the other way
// around. That means the common case (the 1st-3rd distinct reason of a
// session) never flashes, and the rare 4th-distinct case briefly shows the
// banner before this effect removes it, which is the safer direction: real
// content disappearing after a beat, not real content being withheld from
// every first-time visitor while a client-only check runs.
