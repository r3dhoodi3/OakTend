// The single inline "this was written by a model" label that sits with every
// piece of AI-generated output in the app (Ask OakTend's composer, the quote
// analyzer verdict, the pro back-office drafts, inspection/document
// extraction, the tax appeal letter, the insurance packet).
//
// One component so the wording can't drift between surfaces, and so the link
// to /ai-disclosure is always attached to the label rather than being
// something a user has to go hunting for. Deliberately quiet: the same
// text-xs muted stone treatment the surrounding footnotes already use, so it
// reads as honest fine print rather than a warning banner - except on a phone,
// where the xxs variant is bumped to 14px (see `sizeClass`). The xxs variant
// was 11px on desktop until 2026-09-27; nothing readable goes below 12px now.
//
// `detail` appends the surface-specific caveat that used to live inline (e.g.
// "Confirm with a licensed pro before you decide."), keeping it in the same
// sentence flow as the disclosure instead of stacking two paragraphs.
