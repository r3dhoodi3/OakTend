// The phone landing exists so a visitor who already installed the app can get
// into an account without reading a marketing page. Two properties keep that
// true and both are one careless edit away from regressing:
//
//  1. It is PHONE ONLY. The wrapper's `sm:hidden` is the other half of the
//     `max-sm:hidden` marks in src/app/page.tsx - exactly one landing renders
//     at any width, and desktop must be untouched. Drop this class and the
//     desktop page grows a duplicate hero.
//  2. The two role doors point at the real forms. "I'm a homeowner" goes
//     STRAIGHT to /homeowner-signup and "I'm a contractor" to
//     /contractor-signup, not to a "who are you?" role-chooser fork:
//     this screen IS that fork, and routing through it again would cost an
//     extra tap for no answer.
//
// jsdom does not evaluate media queries, so these assert the classes rather
// than visibility - the rendered result is a viewport concern beyond a unit
// test's reach.
