// the shutoff valve, a coin next to the crack for scale). Like

// watches the form's "category" select, so it drops into any form that has
// one (post-a-job, report-an-issue) with no rewiring.

    // On the post-a-job form, `name="category"` is a hidden <input> that
    // CategoryFilter writes via React state (its visible combobox has no
    // `name`), not a field the browser itself changes - so React setting it
    // fires no native DOM event at all. The "change" CategoryFilter dispatches
    // on a pick reaches this form-level listener BEFORE React's own state
    // update commits (this listener sits on the form, closer to the target
    // than React's root listener, so it's earlier in the bubble order),
    // which means a synchronous read here always sees last event's value,
    // never the one that just happened. It would only ever catch up whenever
    // some OTHER field later fired its own change/input - e.g. the
    // description textarea's blur - which is what used to mount this ~130px
    // block late, right as a tap on Post job was already in flight (see
    // PostJobButton). Deferring the read past the current tick lets React's
    // setState from that same event commit first, so it reads the fresh
    // value instead of the stale one.
