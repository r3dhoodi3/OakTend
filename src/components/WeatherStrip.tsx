// the end of the row (see unitToggle below) and converts every temperature
// here and in the expanded week. Always shown when data arrives (unlike HomeAlerts below it, which
// stays alert-only). Shares one /api/home-alerts fetch with HomeAlerts via
// fetchHomeAlerts, and follows the same skeleton contract: a placeholder only
// while the page itself is still loading, then nothing at all if the lookup
// fails - never a stuck or empty box.
// propertyId comes from the dashboard server component: switching homes via
// HomeSwitcher soft-redirects here without remounting, so the effect below
// keys on it to refetch for the new home instead of showing stale weather.
//
// HARD_DEADLINE_MS is the sole ceiling on the skeleton: fetchHomeAlerts
// already caps itself at 6s, so 8s here is purely a second, independent
// backstop - ending the skeleton on its own even if something upstream of
// that promise (hydration, anything) never settles.

// This used to also be gated on a `pageLoaded` flag (true once
// document.readyState / window's "load" fired), meant to give up on the
// skeleton once the page had visibly finished loading. That flag is a
// per-DOCUMENT signal, not a per-NAVIGATION one: after the first hard load
// of the session it stays true for good, so every later client-side
// navigation back to /dashboard (including the redirect from the profile
// menu's side switcher) mounted a fresh WeatherStrip with `pageLoaded`
// already true - collapsing the skeleton before fetchHomeAlerts had any
// realistic chance to resolve, and falling straight through to "no weather
// yet" (rendered as nothing). A hard load rarely hit this because window's
// "load" event fires late enough that the fetch had usually already
// finished by then; a soft navigation always started from "already loaded",
// so the strip skipped straight past the skeleton and could sit empty for
// the length of the fetch. Simply keying the skeleton on `loading` alone -
