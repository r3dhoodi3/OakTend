// table is NOT publicly readable, so the list comes from the service-role
// admin client; only id/slug ever leave the query, both of which are already
// public via the /p/ pages themselves. That client bypasses RLS, so the pro
// query below has to re-state browse_pros()'s own visibility filters by hand
// (claimed row + launch-market gate) or the sitemap advertises pros the
// directory hides. Slug URLs are preferred (0043); rows without a slug
// (pre-migration) fall back to their UUID URL.

// data cache and every crawler hit re-runs the pro query and rebuilds the whole
