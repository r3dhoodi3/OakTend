// AI back office (OakTend Pro membership): five writing tools for the
// paperwork pros hate. The pro describes the job in plain words and Claude
// drafts a clean estimate, invoice, follow-up message, review response, or
// overdue invoice reminder they can copy and send.
//
// Every contractor account gets FREE_PRO_DRAFTS real drafts first (migration
// 0145), then the Pro wall. It was members-only until 2026-08-29, which meant
// a pro was asked to pay for the idea of a draft, having never seen one.
// Members are unmetered here beyond the shared daily/burst ceilings, exactly
// as before; nothing that used to be free moved behind a wall.
//
// Each draft also carries in a few of the pro's own recent edits to that
// same tool (pro_tool_edits, migration 0063) as style guidance, so the
// wording drifts toward how this particular pro actually talks over time.
//
// Input:  { tool: "estimate", description, category?, price?, materials? }
