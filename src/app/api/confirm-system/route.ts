  // is an ordinary one - up to 16 captures in a single sitting. Under the
  // shared burst window that owner is refused on the 11th plate, mid-walk,
  // with no explanation that makes sense to them ("slow down" while they are
  // walking as fast as a person walks). The burst limit exists to stop a
  // script, and it kept catching the feature instead.

  // whole day's spend, the owner-wide breaker and the hourly ceiling both
  // still run, each capture must name a system_id this caller owns (checked
  // above, through RLS), and the body is bounded before any of it. A script
  // pointed here can go faster than a person, but it cannot go past the same
  // daily budget every other tool route shares, which is the limit that
  // actually costs money.
