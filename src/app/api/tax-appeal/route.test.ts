// can be the whole building's, not the unit's, for a condo or multi-family
// home - the same $34,000,000 purchase price and $36,410,541 county
// assessment a real tester was shown on /value and /taxes for a $799,000
// condo (see src/lib/parcelSanity.ts). This test pins that the route refuses
// before ever calling the model or spending one of the owner's daily AI
// usages, using the mocking pattern from src/app/api/health/route.test.ts
