// Daily job (Vercel Cron - add to vercel.json alongside the other crons; the
// exact block belongs to the wave lead since RE does not own that file, see
// docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md) that follows up on the dunning notice the Stripe
// webhook already sent: src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts's
// invoice.payment_failed branch flags the subscriptions row past_due and
// writes ONE in-app notice per failed invoice the moment the card declines.
// That notice is real news the first time. This cron is the second and last
// beat of the same story: if the member has not fixed their card 72 hours
// later, one gentle reminder goes out, and then this cron leaves that
// invoice alone forever (the dedupe below is permanent, not a retry loop).
//
// NO STRIPE CALLS. Unlike renewal-reminders, which has to ask Stripe whether
// a subscription is set to cancel before warning about a charge that will not
// happen, this cron trusts subscriptions.status the same way the webhook's
// own DUNNING_OVERWRITABLE_STATUSES logic does: customer.subscription.updated
// flips the row back to "active" the moment a retry succeeds, so a row still
// reading "past_due" at cron time is still genuinely past due right now.
//
// FINDING "THE FIRST NOTICE" WITHOUT A NEW TABLE. The webhook's notice is
// deduped on (user_id, kind="payment_failed", url), where the url carries the
// Stripe invoice id: `${cancelPath}?billing=past_due&invoice=<id>`. Reading
// that row back - most recent first, kind and cancelPath both matched - gives
// this cron both facts it needs: WHEN the first notice went out (its
// created_at, for the 72-hour gate) and WHICH invoice it was about (the
// `invoice` query param, reused as this cron's own dedupe key). No new table,
// no new column: the notifications row the webhook already writes is the
// entire memory this cron needs.

// The SAME kind DUNNING_KIND the webhook writes (src/app/api/stripe/webhook/
// route.ts). Duplicated here rather than imported - a route.ts file may only
// export its HTTP handlers, so importing a business-logic const out of one is
// not available the way it would be from an ordinary module. The
// renewal-reminders cron and the webhook already duplicate TRIAL_REMINDER_KIND
// this same way for the same reason; see the comment there.
