// Real per-user sign-up. Creates a Supabase Auth account from the user's email
// + password. If email confirmation is OFF in Supabase, the user is signed in
// immediately and sent to claim their home; if it's ON, we swap the form for a
// 6-digit-code panel (EmailCodeVerify): the reader types the code Supabase
// emailed, verifyOtp signs them in on THIS device, and they go straight to
// /onboarding. A code, not a link, so the device that started signup is the one
// that gets the session and can advance - a link opened on a phone can't move
// the desktop along.
//
// ?next=: carried in from /signin (ultimately from the middleware bouncing a
// signed-out visitor off a gated page) via the Google/Apple buttons and the
// sign-up links that thread it. Read
// via the searchParams prop rather than window/useSearchParams so it's
// available with no hydration mismatch or Suspense boundary. Passed through
// to /onboarding on success; the claimed-home gate still routes a brand-new
// homeowner through onboarding first (see onboarding/actions.ts), but their
// destination isn't lost along the way.
//
// ?ref=: a homeowner's personal invite code (migration 0100). It rides along
// to /onboarding exactly the way ?next= does - and exactly the way
// contractor-signup already threads its own ?ref= to /pro/onboarding for the
// pro program - so claimPropertyAction can attribute a first home claim back
// to the neighbor who shared the link. It means nothing outside onboarding,
// so the sign-in / contractor links below keep plain nextQuery.
// searchParams is a Promise since Next 15, and this is a client component, so
// it is unwrapped with React's use() rather than await. Not optional: Next
// always passes it to a page, and `use(undefined)` is a type error (and a
// runtime throw) rather than a graceful fallback. The individual keys stay
// optional, which is what the reads below actually guard against.
