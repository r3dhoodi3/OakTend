// The stable, recoverable email-verification screen. It exists so a closed or
// reloaded signup tab can never strand anyone: the code-entry panel used to
// live only in the signup page's in-memory React state (pendingEmail), so once
// that page was gone the account sat created-but-unconfirmed with no way back -
// sign-in said "email not confirmed" and dead-ended. This page is that way
// back. It is reachable two ways: from the sign-in "email not confirmed"
// fallback (which links here with ?email=), and directly by URL.
//
// EmailCodeVerify already carries the resend button, so we do NOT auto-resend a
// code on load: an auto-resend would fire Supabase's rate limit / abuse guard
// for anyone who reloads this page, and the reader most likely still has the
// code from signup in their inbox. They enter it or tap Resend themselves.
//
// searchParams is a Promise since Next 15, and this is a client component, so
// it is unwrapped with React's use() rather than await - the same pattern the
// signup pages use. The individual keys stay optional, which is what the read
// below guards against.
//
// Client component, so there is no metadata export (Next only reads metadata
// from server components); that is fine for a signed-out recovery utility that
// wants no share preview of its own.

// A deliberately loose "does this look like an email" check, matched to the
// browser's own type="email" validation: a single @ with something either
// side and no spaces. Not an RFC-grade validator - verifyOtp is the real
// gate, and this only decides whether to skip the email-entry step.
