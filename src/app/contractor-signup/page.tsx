// Real per-user contractor sign-up. Creates a Supabase Auth account tagged with
// role=contractor, then sends them to set up their company. If email
// confirmation is OFF in Supabase they're signed in immediately; if ON, we swap
// the form for a 6-digit-code panel (EmailCodeVerify): the reader types the
// code Supabase emailed, verifyOtp signs them in on THIS device, and they go
// straight to /pro/onboarding to set up their company. A code, not a link, so
// the device that started signup is the one that gets the session and can
// advance - a link opened on a phone can't move the desktop along.
//
// ?next=: carried in from /signin same as the homeowner sign-up. Note
// it only survives as far as /pro/onboarding: the company-setup form there
// posts to saveCompanyAction (src/app/pro/actions.ts, owned by another fix),
// which redirects on its own, so a contractor's original destination isn't
// honored past this point. Left alone rather than reaching into that file.
// searchParams is a Promise since Next 15, and this is a client component, so
// it is unwrapped with React's use() rather than await. Not optional: Next
// always passes it to a page, and `use(undefined)` is a type error (and a
// runtime throw) rather than a graceful fallback. The individual keys stay
// optional, which is what the reads below actually guard against.
