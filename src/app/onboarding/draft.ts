// so before this file existed ANY reload, back navigation, or second visit to
// /onboarding dropped the visitor on a blank address entry with everything
// they had typed gone - including the address lookup they had already spent
// a billed parcel call on. On a phone that is the normal case, not the edge

// localStorage rather than sessionStorage (the pro wizard's choice in

// here often comes back in a NEW tab, or the next morning, which is exactly
// the case a session-scoped draft loses. The 7-day floor below is what keeps
// that from turning into a stale draft haunting the form months later.
//
// What goes in it: the address and ZIP they typed, their name, and the parcel
// facts the lookup returned - the same public-record values already on screen
// in the form fields. It stays on the device that typed it, it is cleared the
// moment the claim is submitted, and it expires on its own after a week.
