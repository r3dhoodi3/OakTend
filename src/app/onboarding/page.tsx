  // confirming they land HERE, on the claim-your-home step. But an invited
  // housemate (a spouse, an adult child) has no property of their own to
  // claim; forcing them through this form would strand them, and they'd only
  // reach the invite after claiming a home they don't have. When next points
  // at a /join/ redemption page, skip onboarding entirely and hand them
  // straight there, where the token is redeemed under their new session. This
  // does NOT consume the QR scan grace: the 30-minute window was already
  // stamped when they first opened the invite link (migration 0097), and this
  // redirect just delivers them back to it. The ordinary onboarding flow (no
  // next, or any non-/join destination) is untouched.

  // For them this page is a wrong turn (it used to be the tail of a redirect
  // loop), so send them back to their leads.

  // back to the page they just left - the same refresh-looking loop, one route
  // further along. With the pro side shut there is no "back to their leads" to
  // send them to, so the wandered-in case does not exist: this page is the
  // only side of the product they can use, and it is the first-home setup on
  // the account they are already signed in to. A contractors row has never
  // barred it (see above), so nothing here grants them anything new.
  //
  // Checked LAST so it is only evaluated on the request that would otherwise
  // be bounced, and isProSideOpenForViewer() short-circuits to `true` on the
  // flag, so outside preview this is one string comparison and the redirect is
