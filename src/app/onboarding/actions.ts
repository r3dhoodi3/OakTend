  //    it instead of re-bought. Only the building's public shape travels -
  //    never the other household's purchase price, assessment or owner of
  //    record (see parcelFactsFromExistingProperty in src/lib/parcel.ts). The
  //    household member who joins an existing home and re-runs onboarding is
  //    the case this was written for, and it costs nothing.
  // 2. AN INTERNAL ACCOUNT. Staff, demo and test accounts do not get to spend
  //    real homeowners' monthly budget. They are NOT refused - they fall
  //    straight to manual entry with the same "enter the basics" note anyone
  //    else sees on a miss, so an internal walk-through still exercises the

  // configured RentCast refused the address outright, on the reading that the
  // county would know every real home. It does not. On 2026-08-27 five of ten
  // personas were stopped on plausible Orange County addresses, and the
  // follow-up measured four of them straight against the API - 1920 Main St
  // Irvine, 800 Baker St Costa Mesa, 1201 Magnolia Ave Anaheim, 1620 E 1st St
  // Santa Ana - each a hard 404 in every address format tried, while a
  // known-good address answered in a second. RentCast's coverage of the launch
  // metro is patchy, so refusing on its silence turns one vendor's data gap
  // into a locked front door.
  //
  // So a miss now walks on to the confirm step as manual entry, with copy that
  // says exactly that (OnboardingForm.tsx), no parcel facts attached, and
  // ownership left unverified rather than recorded (shouldRecordOwnershipCheck
  // in src/lib/ownershipMatch.ts).
  //
  // The fake-address job moves to the geocoder, which is a better fit for it:
  // Photon knows all four of those addresses with a house number and knows no
  // invented one. Only asked when RentCast did NOT confirm the address - a
  // record IS confirmation, and there is no sense spending a second lookup to
  // re-learn it.
  //
  // FAILS OPEN by construction: verifyAddressExists returns "unavailable" for
  // a timeout, a non-ok status, or an empty answer, and only "no_match"
  // refuses. Conflating "we couldn't check" with "this does not exist" is the
  // 2026-08-24 outage, and it is not getting repeated with a new vendor.
  //
  // NOT RUN FOR AN INTERNAL ACCOUNT (F3). Nothing was looked up for them, so
  // there is no records silence to second-guess - and the requirement is that
  // an internal account lands on the manual-entry note, not on a refusal. A
  // geocoder verdict here could turn a deliberately skipped lookup into

  // Everything below this point can reach a third party: lookupParcel makes a
  // billed RentCast call for any street nothing has fetched yet, and
  // verifyAddressExists asks Photon whenever there is no county record.
  //
  // Both used to be metered only on the EDITED branch, on the reasoning that
  // an unedited claim re-reads the parcel_cache row the Continue step just
  // wrote and therefore spends nothing. That reasoning holds for the form, and
  // only for the form. address_line1, zip and looked_up_address all arrive as
  // FormData, so a hand-made POST that sets looked_up_address equal to a fresh
  // street on every request takes the "unedited" branch every time, spends a
  // billed RentCast lookup and an uncached Photon call every time, and never
  // consumes a home row to do it - the claim is free to fail afterwards for
  // any reason at all.
  //
  // So the same two per-user buckets lookupParcelAction spends (migration
  // 0068) are spent here first, whichever branch runs. A real signup pays one
  // extra token per claim against a 10/hour, 25/day budget, which no

  // and skip the lookup step entirely. Without this, "123 Fake St" still
  // creates a real home row.
  //
  // The lookup itself is usually free: an edited address already paid for
  // relookupFacts above, and an unedited one hits the parcel_cache row
  // (migration 0069) the Continue step just wrote - the same cached read the
  // ownership check further down already makes. "Usually" is why it is metered
  // anyway a few lines up: a POST that never went through the Continue step
  // has no cache row waiting for it.
  //
  // The decision itself is claimAddressGate (src/lib/parcelGate.ts), which is
  // where its reasoning and its tests live. In short: the GEOCODER decides
  // whether the address is real, and only its explicit "no_match" refuses. A
  // records miss does not refuse any more - RentCast's coverage of the launch
  // metro was measured on 2026-08-28 and is patchy enough that its silence
  // says nothing about whether a home exists (see lookupParcelAction above).
  // Neither does a records outage, or a geocoder outage, or a lookup that
  // threw: "we couldn't check" is not "this address does not exist", and that

  // facts to attach and nothing to decide on.
  //
  // claimFacts is also what the ownership check at the end of this action

  // extendedRow's enrichment fields (everything migration 0066 adds) aren't
  // in src/lib/database.types.ts yet, so this call is cast to any - same
  // pattern as saveHomeValueAction (value/actions.ts) and
  // saveTaxAssessmentAction (taxes/actions.ts) for their own not-yet-typed
  // columns, rather than widening the generated types by hand.
  // WHICH CLIENT WRITES THE ROW: the session client, exactly as before -
  // EXCEPT in homeowner preview mode (src/lib/previewMode.ts), where it is the
  // admin (service_role) client.
  //
  // WHY. Preview gives every homeowner Plus, including the 5-home allowance
  // (ownsPlus() above returns true), but the DB backstop
  // enforce_properties_home_cap (migration 0108) derives Plus from the
  // subscriptions table directly - and a preview homeowner has no row there.
  // It would refuse their SECOND home with "free accounts can track 1 home",
  // and no amount of app-side generosity can talk it out of that. Migration
  // 0168 adds ONE clause to that function: a service_role insert returns early
  // instead of being counted. This is the other half - the only caller that
  // ever takes the new path, and only while the flag is on.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS NOT A HOLE. The cap is still enforced, by the action rather
  // than by the trigger: the `ownedHomes.length >= cap` check at the top of
  // this function is untouched and still refuses a 6th home with the same
  // message. The row written is the same server-built row, and its user_id
  // comes from supabase.auth.getUser() - re-verified against Supabase's auth
  // server, never read off the request body - so service_role cannot be
  // steered into filing a home under somebody else. What the admin client
  // skips is RLS ("properties owner insert", which only checks
  // user_id = auth.uid() and would pass anyway) and the cap trigger. The
  // ownership-lock trigger (0093) and the global address-unique index (0162)
  // do not depend on the role and still apply.
