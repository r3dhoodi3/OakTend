                  the records source was unreachable (bad key, exhausted free
                  tier, outage, timeout - source "unavailable"), it answered and
                  holds no record (source "none"), or no lookup was made at all
                  because the account is internal (also "none", see
                  lookupParcelAction in ./actions.ts).

                  It used to be two notes, one per source, on the reasoning that
                  "we couldn't reach the county records" and "we don't have
                  county records for this address yet" are genuinely different
                  facts and the copy should not blame an outage that did not
                  happen. That reasoning still holds and this line respects it -
                  it blames NEITHER. It says only what is true in all three
                  cases and what the homeowner can act on: the boxes below are
                  empty and they should fill them in. A homeowner cannot do
                  anything differently on an outage than on a coverage gap, so
                  splitting the copy bought them a distinction they could not
                  use, and a single line is one less thing between them and the
                  form.

                  The fields themselves are untouched by this: year built,
                  square feet, beds and lot below take defaultValue={facts.X ??
