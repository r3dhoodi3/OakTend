// Web app manifest: what makes "Add to Home Screen" / "Install app" produce a
// real app icon that opens full-screen. Served at /manifest.webmanifest and
// linked from the root layout's metadata. Safari on iOS ignores the icons
// here and uses apple-icon.tsx instead; Android and desktop Chrome read this.
// start_url is the launch shell at /open (src/app/open/page.tsx), not the
// dashboard itself. Pointing straight at /dashboard meant a serverless cold
// start plus the signed-out 307 to /signin could leave the installed app on a
// blank white screen for seconds, which the owner hit in the wild. The shell
// is force-static, so the CDN paints OakTend branding instantly even on a cold
// start, then forwards to the dashboard, which still owns the auth bounce.
// The ?source=pwa on it is just an attribution marker (nothing reads it yet)
// so installed-app traffic can eventually be told apart from a browser tab.
// The shell itself reads no params, on purpose, so it stays fully static; its
// hardcoded forward target is /dashboard?source=pwa, which keeps the marker.
// Built once at deploy time, not per request: nothing below reads a param, a
// cookie or the database, so the bytes are a constant of the deployment.
