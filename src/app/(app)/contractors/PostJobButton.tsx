// The same 10-character floor postJobAction enforces on the server. Catching it
// here first means a too-short post never submits, so the form (and any photos
// already uploaded into its hidden inputs) is never wiped by the server-side
// redirect that drops the POST body.

// Submit button for the post-a-job form. Disables itself while the action is in
// flight so a double-click can't post the same job twice, and blocks submit
// with an inline message when the description is too short (mirroring the
// server), so nothing the homeowner typed or uploaded gets lost.
//
// IMPORTANT - the form region above this button (DescriptionField,
// StrongPostMeter) must never change height while the description textarea
// is focused. A tap on this button first fires mousedown/touchstart at the
// button's on-screen position, then blurs the textarea (which had focus),
// then fires mouseup/click at that SAME position. If anything above this
// button grows or shrinks in that window, the button's screen position
// moves and mouseup lands on whatever slid into its place instead - the
// browser then dispatches click to the nearest common ancestor (the form),
// and this onClick handler never runs. That's exactly what used to happen:
// DescriptionField conditionally mounted/unmounted a helper sentence based
// on whether the owner had typed by hand, which could add or remove a
// wrapped line right as they tapped Post. The fix lives in DescriptionField
// (keep the helper mounted, toggle `invisible` instead of unmounting) -
// don't "fix" this by switching to pointerdown-based submission; that
// papers over layout instability instead of removing it.
