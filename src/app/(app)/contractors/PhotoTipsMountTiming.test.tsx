// Regression test for the second cause of the silent Post-job failure:
// PhotoTips watches the form for "category" changes, but on this page
// `name="category"` is a hidden <input> CategoryFilter writes via React
// state - a value React sets programmatically fires no native DOM event, so
// PhotoTips only ever caught up whenever some OTHER field (the description
// textarea, on blur) happened to fire its own change/input event, mounting
// a ~130px tips block right as a tap on Post job was in flight. The fix
// defers the read past the same tick React commits the hidden input, and
// also listens for "input" (debounced) so typing elsewhere resyncs it too.
