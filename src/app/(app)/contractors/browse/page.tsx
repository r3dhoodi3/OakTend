// C8 (2026-09-07 tester wave): filtering used to be a server round trip per
// tap (a <Link> to a new ?category=&rating=, which re-ran this whole page,
// including a redundant re-fetch of the active property). Fixed by fetching
// browse_pros ONCE here, with no category filter - it already returns a
// small, launch-market list capped at 200 rows - and filtering it in the
// browser (BrowseProsBoard.tsx), the same client-side pattern the leads
// board's sort buttons use. getActiveProperty and the RPC also now run in
// parallel instead of a serial waterfall, since neither depends on the other.
