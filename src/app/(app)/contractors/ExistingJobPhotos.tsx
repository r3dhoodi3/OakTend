// issue_id, so these ride along with no re-upload needed. Removing one here
// is real removal, not just a UI hide: since the photo row is shared with the
// issue tracker, "remove_photo_ids" tells postJobAction to delete that photo
// outright (scoped to this issue) rather than leaving a confusing mismatch
// where the pro's job shows fewer photos than the Issues page does.
