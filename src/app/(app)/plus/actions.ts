  // they consent to say exactly that - billingTerms() takes the "charged today"

  // subscription list. None of them can see a checkout that is still in
  // flight. So a first-ever buyer could open /plus in two tabs and tap Start
  // free days in both: both read "no row yet", both got trial_period_days, and
  // one account minted two free trials (the second surviving as an orphan
  // subscription with no row and therefore no in-app cancel button pointing at
  // it, which then bills at trial end).
  //
  // The fix is the one the Pro side already uses for its intro price:
  // atomically claim a promo_claims row before the Stripe session is created.
  // promo_claims' primary key is (user_id, promo_key) (migration 0073), so
  // claim_promo()'s "on conflict do nothing ... return found" lets exactly ONE
  // of N racing requests win; every other one falls straight through to a
  // charged-today checkout, with the disclosure and the consent record built
  // from the same `freeTrial` value, so nothing on screen promises free days
  // that are not coming. claim_promo is service_role-only, hence the admin
  // client.
  //
  // It doubles as a lifecycle-independent ledger: the row is never pruned by a
  // cancellation, so a churned member whose subscriptions row is ever deleted
  // still cannot farm a second trial.
  //
  // A reservation that is never spent - the buyer closes the Stripe tab, the
  // card is declined, Stripe fails to create the session at all - is released
  // again: by the webhook on checkout.session.expired and on a subscription
  // that lands canceled/incomplete_expired without ever going live, and inline
  // in the catch below for a session that was never created. `trial_reserved`
  // in the session metadata is how the webhook recognizes which attempt holds
  // it.
  //
  // A FAILED RPC MEANS NO TRIAL. Unlike the Pro intro (which fails through to
  // full price for the same reason), free days are the thing being farmed here,
  // and "the counter was unreadable" must never be a way to get a second one.
  //
  // WHEN THE CLAIM IS LOST, ASK WHO HOLDS IT. This is the live bug: the webhook
  // only releases an abandoned reservation when Stripe expires the session, up
  // to 24 hours later, so a buyer who opened Stripe Checkout and pressed back
  // lost the race against their own dead reservation on every click after that.
  // The old code read that as "no trial" and built a different request body
  // under the same idempotency key, which Stripe refused outright
  // (StripeIdempotencyError) - so the button simply stopped working. And once
  // the key's time bucket rolled over it got worse than an error: a session
  // with no trial, sold under a button that says free 3 day trial.
