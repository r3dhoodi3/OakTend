// free-vs-Plus grid still lives in the "See everything included" disclosure on
// the page for anyone who wants it.
//
// Three cards - Weekly, Monthly, Annual - in one row at every width via
// `grid-cols-3`, about 110px each at 390px. THE CARD IS THE SELECTOR - tapping
// one moves the accent outline to it and re-labels the single button
// underneath (and, on a phone, rewrites the panel below), so there is exactly
// one primary action on the page instead of a button per column.
//
// MONTHLY is preselected in every state: $4.99 is the anchor the whole page is
// priced around, with weekly above it per month and annual below it, and
// startPlusCheckoutAction falls back to the same cadence, so the hidden field
// and the server can never disagree. It used to preselect Weekly whenever the
// trial was on offer, because the free days were weekly's and a separate
// "Start N free days" button at the top of this file posted weekly. Both are
// gone: the free days now come with whichever card is selected, so preselecting
// the cheapest cadence would just be steering.
//
// PHONE DISCLOSURE: TWO COPIES OF AutoRenewalTerms, ONE PER BREAKPOINT.
// The checkout form below renders the block twice - once inside a `sm:hidden`
// <details> that starts CLOSED, once inside a `max-sm:hidden` div that renders
// exactly as it always did. On a 390px screen the full block ran about a third
// of a screen and pushed the button it belongs to below the fold, which is the
// scrolling the owner asked us to stop.
//
// What is collapsed is the ITEMIZED version, never the material terms. The
// one-line summary (panelBilling[plan]: "3 days free, then $39.99/year. Cancel
// anytime before the trial ends." for an eligible buyer on annual) stays on
// screen
// unconditionally, directly beside the button, which is what ROSCA
// 15 U.S.C. 8403(1) and Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 17602(a)(1) are about: material
// terms disclosed before billing information is collected, in visual proximity
// to the request for consent. One tap opens the rest, and it is inside the
// same form as the button either way.
//
// Two elements rather than one because `open` is a boolean attribute that no
// media query can drive, and flipping it from JS on mount would either flash
// or mismatch hydration.
//
// THE STORED CONSENT RECORD IS UNAFFECTED. billingTermsText in the Stripe
// metadata is built SERVER-SIDE by startPlusCheckoutAction from
// src/lib/billingTerms.ts, off the posted cadence, never from what this
// component rendered. AutoRenewalTerms reads that same module, so the screen
// and the record cannot disagree no matter which copy is on screen.
//
// THE 3 FREE DAYS COME WITH EVERY CADENCE, not with weekly alone. They are one
// per ACCOUNT (the promo_claims reservation in startPlusCheckoutAction is what
// enforces that), so an eligible buyer who wants the annual plan starts the
// same 3 free days and then renews annually, instead of having to buy weekly
// first and switch afterwards. This mirrors the Pro side, which has always
// trialed on both of its cadences. `trialEligible` mirrors the "no existing
// homeowner subscription row" signal startPlusCheckoutAction checks;
// billingTerms() is the one place the rule is applied, so the disclosure, the
// consent record, and the Stripe trial cannot disagree.
//
// THE PICKER IS THE WHOLE DECISION. There is one checkout form, one button, and
// one line of material terms, all following the selected card. A separate
// weekly-only "Start 3 free days" form used to sit above the cards; it made the
// free days look like a fourth plan and quietly meant weekly, which is the

            wants them in visual proximity to the request for consent. It
            renders ONCE, for the SELECTED plan, which is why the card is the
            selector and the button is single: the terms on screen are always
            the terms of the plan the button would charge. AutoRenewalTerms
            reads src/lib/billingTerms.ts - the same source as the consent
            record stashed in Stripe metadata and the acknowledgment sent
            afterwards - so the sentences here are word for word what gets
            stored and emailed, including the free days and the price they
            step up to on whichever cadence is selected. */}

            so nothing behind the disclosure below is a fact the reader was not
            shown. sm and up already reads it as the first line of the block
