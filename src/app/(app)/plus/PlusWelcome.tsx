// Animated stepped tour shown right after checkout, off the ?welcome=1 flag.
// Client-side so Next/Back/dots can advance instantly with no round trip.
// Each step re-mounts on `key={step}` so the fade/slide-in transition replays.
//
// The tour also carries the post-purchase acknowledgment California requires
// (Bus. & Prof. Code 17602(a)(3)): the renewal terms, the cancellation policy,
// and how to cancel. It sits on the LAST step rather than the first so it is
// the thing still on screen when the celebration ends, and it never competes
// with the confirmation itself.
//
// `plan` is undefined until the Stripe webhook writes the subscription row,
// which races this screen. When that happens the block degrades to the parts
// that are true regardless (how to cancel) and points at the emailed
// acknowledgment, which the webhook sends with the exact billed terms.
