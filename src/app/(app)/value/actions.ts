// ever fires when there is no value on file (the auto-fetch on claim or first
// visit), and it has no membership check on purpose.
//
// REFRESHING an estimate that already exists is the Plus half, and it is the
// only path that can bill RentCast a second time for the same home.
// refreshMarketValueAction is the one such path, and it checks hasPlus() on
// the server before it spends anything. The UI shows the door before the tap
// (a "Plus" tag on the button, one line under the number), so a free account
// never discovers this by being refused.

// Shared abuse limits for anything here that can reach RentCast. Its own
// buckets, not the address-lookup ones onboarding spends: an AVM refresh must
// not be able to eat the budget a new home needs to get claimed. Same fixed
// window RPC and the same fail-open posture as every other rate_limit_hit call
// in this codebase - a limiter hiccup must not break a refresh - and both the
// automatic first fetch and the manual Plus refresh count against the same
// per-user budget, because they cost the same money.
