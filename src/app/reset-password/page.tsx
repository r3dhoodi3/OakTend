// Server wrapper so the route can export metadata; the form itself is a
// client component. Two steps in one route:
//   /reset-password              → ask for an email, send the recovery link
//   /reset-password?step=update  → back from the emailed link (via
//                                  /auth/callback or /auth/confirm, which
//                                  turn the code into a recovery session) →
//                                  set a new password.
//
// The update step needs BOTH signals: ?step=update AND the httpOnly
// oaktend_pwrecovery cookie one of those two auth routes sets when it has just
// completed a recovery exchange. The query string alone used to be enough,
// which meant anyone sitting at an already-signed-in browser could type the
// URL and change the password without knowing the old one - see the note in
// src/lib/passwordRecovery.ts. With no cookie the page falls back to step one
// (ask for an email), which is the honest thing to show someone who arrived
// here without a live reset link, and it tells an attacker nothing.

  // standing between "typed the URL" and "change the password" - could be
  // satisfied by a name nothing writes any more. src/app/reset-password/
  // actions.ts still DELETES both names, which is the half that has to stay.
