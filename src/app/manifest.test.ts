// The manifest's start_url is what the installed app opens to, usually with
// no session on the very first request after a launch. Two things are pinned
// so they cannot drift apart:
//
//   1. It points at the static launch shell (/open), not the dashboard. The
//      shell exists because a serverless cold start plus the signed-out 307
//      left the installed app on a blank white screen; pointing start_url
//      back at a dynamic page would quietly reintroduce that.
//   2. Whatever it points at is public in the middleware. A guarded start_url
//      would bounce the very first paint to /signin before anything rendered,
//      which is the same blank-screen failure by another route.
