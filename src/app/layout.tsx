// read here opts the ENTIRE build out of static generation - every public
// marketing and SEO page included. This layout used to call readFlash(), which
// calls cookies(), and the result was a build with zero static pages. The
// flash toast now reads its own cookie on the client (see FlashToast below);
// the theme is applied by the inline script in <head>, which runs in the
// browser and touches nothing server-side; the fonts and the JSON-LD are
// build-time constants. Anything new added here has to stay in that category.

// Self-hosted via next/font, exposed as a CSS variable so Tailwind's
// font-sans (see tailwind.config.ts) picks it up everywhere.

// class is added only when the user has actually chosen dark in ThemeToggle.
// The OS preference is deliberately not consulted - a visitor whose phone is
// in dark mode still gets OakTend's light look until they ask otherwise.
// The legacy pre-rename key is checked as a fallback here (split so the old
// brand name doesn't appear literally in source) because this inline script
// runs synchronously before paint, ahead of migrateLegacyStorage's one-time
// client-side copy - see src/lib/legacyStorage.ts.
