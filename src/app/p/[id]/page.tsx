// Public, shareable business page for a pro: /p/<contractor_id> or, once
// migration 0043 lands, /p/<slug>. No account needed. Data comes from the
// public_pro_profile RPC (0033, extended with 'slug' in 0043), which returns
// only safe fields: name, categories, the REAL rating/reviews (same math and
// ordering as everywhere else, membership never touches them), the free
// license "on file" boolean (0109, shown for every pro), and, for Pro members
// only, logo + about. Never contact info. The RPC also returns has_insurance;
// this page deliberately renders nothing from it - insurance is private.
//
// STAYS DYNAMIC, deliberately, even though this is the most SEO-valuable
// surface in the app. The root layout's cookie read is gone (see
// src/app/layout.tsx), so the remaining blocker is entirely in the body below:
// auth.getUser() decides between a real direct-request form (signed-in
// homeowner, migration 0104) and the create-an-account link. Adding
// generateStaticParams + revalidate here would change nothing on its own - a
// cookies()-backed read inside the page opts the render back out to
// per-request no matter what the segment config says - and forcing it static
// would break the signed-in "Request a quote" CTA, which is the page's whole
// conversion path. Making this static means moving that one CTA decision into
// a client component that resolves the session in the browser (RequestQuoteForm
// can import requestProAction directly), leaving the profile body - the part
// Google actually indexes - free to prerender against the RPC with
// generateStaticParams: [] + revalidate. Worth doing; too big for this pass.
