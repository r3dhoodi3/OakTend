// Called from two places: the signup pages (src/app/homeowner-signup/page.tsx,
// src/app/contractor-signup/page.tsx) right after signUp() returns a session
// (confirmation OFF, or the required agreement checkbox was checked), and
// /auth/callback/route.ts right after it exchanges a confirmation code for a
// session (confirmation ON - signUp() itself returned no session, so the
// signup page's own call never fired). Uses the admin client because the
// table's RLS "insert own" policy targets the `authenticated` role, and the
// signup-page call path can run before the browser's new session cookie has
// propagated back to a server-side request.
//
// Idempotent by design (see the existence check below): a confirmation link
// can be visited more than once (a stale/reused link, a reload, or a double
// call from both entry points above for the same account), and
// terms_acceptances has no unique constraint of its own - it's an
// append-only audit trail with intentionally no update/delete policy - so
// the duplicate guard has to live here instead.
//
// TODO(legal): bump VERSION whenever /terms or /pro-terms changes materially.
// 2026-08-30: /pro-terms gained the insurance duty + venue clause (big-job
// proof-of-insurance gate, migration 0153), which is a material change.
// 2026-09-20: /terms and /pro-terms reworded for the homeowner preview (the
// payment story, contact release, finding a pro by hand). Nothing reads this
// value to gate anything; it only stamps new acceptance rows.
