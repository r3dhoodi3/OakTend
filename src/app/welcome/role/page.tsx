  // "contractor" stamp and owns nothing: every landing sent it to
  // /pro/onboarding, and the one screen that could have let it change its mind
  // bounced it back there. With neither row there is nothing built to protect,
  // so the question gets asked again. The stamp still decides the DEFAULT
  // landing everywhere else; it just no longer closes this door.

  // side, and this redirect is now reached only when a side exists.
