// tell apart was "there is no row" from "we could not read the rows" - a
// non-schema DB error made getCurrentContractor() return null, getSides()
// reported hasPro/hasHome false, and the guard sailed straight past on an
// outage that had nothing to do with this account. Fail-open on a security
// guard, so it is now refused with a plain retry message.
//
// A NEXT_REDIRECT is Next's throw-to-navigate mechanism, not a crash, so the
// mock reproduces that shape and the assertions catch only that marker.
