const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does a kitchen remodel cost in Orange County?",
    a: "In Orange County and Southern California, a kitchen remodel typically runs about $50,000 to $75,000 for a full project. The wider range across SoCal spans roughly $35,000 for a budget refresh up to $170,000 or more for a high-end custom kitchen. California labor and permitting tend to add roughly 10 to 20 percent over comparable national costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cost per square foot for a kitchen remodel?",
    a: "A kitchen remodel typically runs about $75 to $250 per square foot, depending on the level of finish. Stock cabinets and mid-range appliances sit toward the lower end, while custom cabinetry, stone counters, and professional-grade appliances push toward the top.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the most expensive part of a kitchen remodel?",
    a: "Cabinets are usually the single biggest line item. Custom cabinetry can run around $600 per linear foot, and countertops add up quickly too, with high-end stone reaching $550 or more per square foot installed. Together, cabinets and counters often make up the largest share of a kitchen budget.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit and a licensed contractor for a kitchen remodel in California?",
    a: "California requires a CSLB contractor license for any job of $1,000 or more, counting labor and materials combined, as of January 1, 2025. The under-$1,000 exemption does not apply if the job needs any permit, if the person hires helpers, or if a big job is split into smaller contracts. On permits, moving electrical, plumbing, or gas, or taking down a wall, generally requires one in OC cities, while purely cosmetic updates like paint or new cabinet fronts generally do not. Check with your local building department.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a kitchen remodel add value at resale?",
    a: "Minor and mid-range kitchen remodels tend to recoup a larger share of their cost at resale than upscale ones, though neither usually returns the full amount. Beyond resale, an updated, functional kitchen is one of the rooms buyers and daily users notice most, which is part of why it stays a popular project.",
