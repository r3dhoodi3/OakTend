const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does an ADU cost in Orange County?",
    a: "It depends heavily on the type. In Orange County, a garage conversion typically runs about $100,000 to $185,000, an attached ADU about $160,000 to $350,000, and a detached ADU about $200,000 to $450,000 or more. On a per-square-foot basis, OC ADUs commonly run around $300 to $400 per square foot. There is no reliable single national average, since published figures diverge widely.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cheapest type of ADU to build?",
    a: "Converting an existing garage is usually the cheapest path to an ADU, typically about $100,000 to $185,000 in Orange County. Because the walls, roof, and foundation already exist, you avoid the biggest costs of new construction. The main expenses become insulation, plumbing, electrical, and finishes to turn the shell into a livable unit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need my city's approval and a hearing to build an ADU in California?",
    a: "California ADU approval is ministerial, which means no public hearings. The city reviews your application against the rules and must decide within 60 days. If it misses that deadline, the application is deemed approved. Cities also cannot cap ADU size below 850 square feet for a studio or one-bedroom, or 1,000 square feet for two or more bedrooms. These rules come from California Government Code sections 66310 through 66342.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I have to live on the property to rent out an ADU in California?",
    a: "For standard ADUs, there is no statewide owner-occupancy requirement. That rule was made permanent in 2024 under AB 976, so you generally can build an ADU and rent it without living on site, though local rules and other permit conditions still apply. Check your city for any specifics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is an ADU a good investment?",
    a: "If you are counting on resale, an ADU tends to recoup only a modest share of its cost, often around 41 percent, so resale alone is a weak case. The stronger case is usually rental income, commonly about $1,800 to $4,000 a month for a California ADU, or housing family without paying separate rent or a mortgage elsewhere. Framed as ongoing income or avoided housing cost, the math looks very different than resale.",

            Garage conversion: the cheapest path to an ADU
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Converting an existing garage is usually the most affordable way
            to add an ADU, typically about $100,000 to $185,000 in Orange
            County. The reason is simple: the walls, roof, and foundation are
            already there, so you skip the largest costs of new construction.
            The budget instead goes toward insulation, drywall, plumbing,
            electrical, a kitchen and bathroom, windows, and finishes to turn
            a bare shell into a comfortable, code-compliant living space.

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            The main variables are how much plumbing and electrical the garage
            needs, whether the slab and roof are sound, and how far the
            existing utilities reach. A garage close to the main home&apos;s water,
            sewer, and panel converts more cheaply than one that needs long
            new utility runs.

            California ADU rules worth knowing
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            California has made ADUs far easier to build than most homeowners
            expect. Approval is <strong>ministerial</strong>, which means no
            public hearings: the city reviews your application against the
            rules and must decide within <strong>60 days</strong>. If it
            misses that deadline, the application is deemed approved. Cities
            also cannot cap ADU size below 850 square feet for a studio or
            one-bedroom, or 1,000 square feet for two or more bedrooms. For
            standard ADUs there is no statewide owner-occupancy requirement,
            made permanent in 2024 under AB 976, so you generally can build and
            rent without living on site. These rules come from California
            Government Code sections 66310 through 66342.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            An ADU is a structural project, so it needs permits and a licensed
            contractor. California requires a CSLB contractor license for any
            job of <strong>$1,000 or more</strong>, counting labor and
            materials together, as of January 1, 2025. The under-$1,000
            exemption does not apply if the job needs any permit, if the person
            hires helpers, or if a larger job is split into smaller contracts,
            all of which describe an ADU. Structural, electrical, plumbing, and
            gas work generally requires permits in OC cities, and changes to
            lighting, HVAC, windows, or the building envelope can trigger
            California energy-code (Title 24) compliance. Rules vary by city,
            so check with your local building department.

            A note on value: think income, not resale
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            If you are counting on resale to justify the cost, an ADU tends to
            recoup only a modest share, often around 41 percent, so resale
            alone is a weak case. The stronger case is ongoing value. A
            California ADU commonly rents for about $1,800 to $4,000 a month,
            which can offset a meaningful part of a mortgage over time. Housing
            a family member is the other common motivation, replacing separate
            rent or a mortgage elsewhere. Framed as monthly income or avoided
            housing cost rather than a resale bump, the math looks very
            different.
