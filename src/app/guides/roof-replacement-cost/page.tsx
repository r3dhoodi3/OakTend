const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to replace a roof?",
    a: "Nationally, a roof replacement typically runs about $8,000 to $18,000. In Orange County the numbers tend to run higher. An asphalt shingle roof on a typical 2,000 square foot home commonly estimates around $13,000 to $28,000, and a tile roof often estimates $22,000 to $50,000 or more. Where you land depends on the roof's size and pitch, the material, tearing off the old roof, and repairing any rotted decking underneath.",
  },
  {
    q: "Asphalt shingle or tile, which is better in Southern California?",
    a: "This is the real Orange County decision. Asphalt shingles cost less upfront and are faster to install, and a quality architectural shingle holds up well here. Tile costs much more but lasts far longer and suits the Spanish and Mediterranean styles common across the county. Tile is also heavier, so the roof structure has to be able to carry it. Many homeowners weigh the lower upfront cost of shingle against the longer life of tile.",
  },
  {
    q: "When is a roof repair enough instead of a full replacement?",
    a: "A repair usually makes sense when the roof is still well within its expected life and the problem is contained, like a few damaged or lifted shingles, some cracked tiles, or flashing that has pulled away around a vent or chimney. A full replacement tends to make more sense once the roof is near or past its expected life, leaks show up in more than one spot, or the decking underneath has started to rot.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit to re-roof my house in Orange County?",
    a: "Re-roofing generally requires a building permit in Orange County cities, and the specifics vary by city. Your contractor usually pulls it, but you should confirm one is being pulled. Check with your city's building department for the exact requirement and any fire-related roofing rules that apply to your address.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long should a new roof last?",
    a: "It depends heavily on the material. Asphalt shingles commonly last around 20 to 25 years, and premium architectural shingles can go longer. Concrete and clay tile roofs can last 50 years or more, though the underlayment beneath the tile usually needs replacing well before the tile itself does. Sun exposure, ventilation, and maintenance all affect where a given roof actually lands.",

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A common way to estimate a roof locally is by the square foot of

            California:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5 leading-relaxed">
            <li>
              <strong>Asphalt shingle:</strong> roughly $5 to $9.50 per square

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            These are planning ranges, not quotes. A steep or complex roof, a

            Asphalt vs. tile: the real SoCal decision
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            In Orange County the choice usually comes down to asphalt shingle
            versus tile. Asphalt shingle costs less upfront, installs faster,
            and a quality architectural shingle performs well in this climate.
            Tile costs considerably more, but it lasts far longer and fits the
            Spanish and Mediterranean styles that are so common here.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Tile is also heavy, so the roof structure has to be built or rated
            to carry it. If you are switching from shingle to tile, a contractor
            may need to confirm the framing can take the added weight. Many
            homeowners end up weighing the lower upfront cost of shingle against
            the longer life of tile.

            When a repair beats a replacement
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            You do not always need a whole new roof. A repair is usually the
            right call when the roof is still well within its expected life and
            the problem is contained, such as a handful of lifted or damaged
            shingles, a few cracked tiles, or flashing that has pulled away
            around a vent or chimney. Replacement tends to make more sense once
            the roof is near or past its expected life, water shows up in more
            than one area, or the decking underneath has begun to rot. A leak in
            one spot is a repair question; widespread wear is a replacement
            question.

            Permits in Orange County
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Re-roofing generally requires a building permit in Orange County
            cities. The details, fees, and any inspections vary from city to
            city. In most cases the roofing contractor pulls the permit, but it
            is worth confirming a permit is actually being pulled for your job,
            since a permitted roof leaves a clean record for a future sale.
            Check with your city&apos;s building department for the exact
            requirement at your address.

            Insurance and fire hardening
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Roofing carries extra weight in Southern California because of
            wildfire risk. The roof is one of the most important parts of a
            fire-hardened home, and many insurers look closely at roof age,
            material, and condition when they write or renew a policy. Class A
            fire-rated roofing, which includes most tile and many modern asphalt
            shingle systems, is the standard many homeowners aim for. If your
            home is in or near a high fire hazard area, ask your contractor
            about fire-rated materials and ask your insurer whether the roof
            affects your coverage or premium. Rules and insurer requirements
            change, so confirm the current specifics for your address.
