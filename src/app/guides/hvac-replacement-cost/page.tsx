const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to replace an HVAC system?",
    a: "Nationally, replacing a home HVAC system typically runs about $5,000 to $10,000. Where you land in that range depends mostly on the size of unit your home needs, its efficiency rating, whether the ductwork needs work, and the labor to install it and charge the refrigerant.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I get a heat pump instead of central AC?",
    a: "A standard central air conditioner only cools, so you still need a separate furnace for heat. A heat pump does both jobs with one outdoor unit, moving heat in or out depending on the season, and tends to be more efficient in mild climates. It usually costs more upfront than a straight AC swap, but replaces two systems with one.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I repair my HVAC instead of replacing it?",
    a: "Repair usually makes sense for a system that is still well within its typical 18-year lifespan and has one clear, contained problem, like a failed capacitor or a refrigerant leak in an otherwise sound unit. Replacement tends to make more sense once the system is at or past that typical age, needs a major component like the compressor or heat exchanger, or keeps coming back for repeat repairs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does living near the coast in Orange County affect my HVAC system?",
    a: "Coastal Orange County communities generally run milder and see less extreme heat than inland areas, so an AC system there often runs fewer hours per year. Less run time is generally easier on a system, though your specific unit's age, install quality, and maintenance history still matter more than location alone.",

            Central AC vs. heat pump
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A standard central air conditioner only cools your home, so you
            still need a separate furnace for heat. A heat pump handles both
            heating and cooling with one outdoor unit, moving heat in during
            winter and out during summer, and tends to be more efficient in
            milder climates where temperatures rarely swing to extremes. It
            typically costs more upfront than a plain AC swap, but it is
            replacing what would otherwise be two separate systems.

            When repair beats replacement
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            An HVAC system has a typical working life of about 18 years. If
            yours is well under that and the issue is a single, contained
            part, like a capacitor, blower motor, or a refrigerant leak in an
            otherwise sound system, a repair is usually the faster and
            cheaper path. Replacement tends to make more sense once the
            system is at or past its typical lifespan, needs a major part
            like the compressor or heat exchanger, or has needed more than
            one repair recently.

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Coastal Orange County communities generally run milder than

            system there often runs fewer hours in a typical year than the
            same system further inland. Less run time is generally easier on
            equipment, though a system&apos;s age, install quality, and
