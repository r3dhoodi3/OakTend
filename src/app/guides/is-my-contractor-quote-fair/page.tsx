            How to read a quote
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Start with whether it&apos;s itemized. A fair quote breaks out
            materials from labor rather than handing you a single total, so
            you can see what you&apos;re actually paying for each. It should say
            plainly whether permits are included in the price or billed
            separately, and if the job requires one, whether the contractor
            is pulling it. Look for a specific description of the work, not a
            generic line like &quot;repair as needed,&quot; along with a realistic
            start date and estimated completion window, and a payment
            schedule that ties payments to stages of completed work instead
            of asking for everything upfront.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Red flags</h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Be cautious of pressure to sign the same day the quote is given,
            or a demand for full payment before any work begins. A
            contractor who can&apos;t or won&apos;t give you a license number, business
            address, or proof of insurance is a red flag on its own. So are
            vague line items that lump everything into one number, and a
            price that comes in far below every other bid with no clear
            reason, since it often means something gets cut later, whether
            that&apos;s materials, permits, or the scope itself.

            What a fair process looks like
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            For anything beyond a small repair, it&apos;s worth getting more than
            one quote so you have something to compare against. Look at the
            itemized breakdown, not just the bottom line, confirm the
            license and insurance independently rather than taking the
            contractor&apos;s word for it, and get everything in writing,
            including a payment schedule tied to milestones rather than a
            single deposit. None of this guarantees a low price, but it
            gives you a much clearer picture of what you&apos;re actually paying
            for.
