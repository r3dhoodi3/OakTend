const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What's the most important home maintenance task in coastal Southern California?",
    a: "There isn't one single task, but the HVAC filter is the easiest to skip and one of the cheapest ways to protect an expensive system, especially July through September when the AC is running daily. Right behind it: watching for drywood termite swarmers in late summer and clearing gutters before the first rain in fall.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are drywood termite swarmers?",
    a: "Winged termites that leave a colony to start a new one, usually flying around eaves, attic vents, and windowsills from roughly August through October in Southern California. They look like flying ants at a glance; a pile of small discarded wings on a windowsill is the clearest sign it was actually termites.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Santa Ana wind prep?",
    a: "Getting ahead of the strong, dry offshore wind events that typically start in September: trimming dead or overhanging tree limbs, securing or storing patio furniture, and checking for loose roof tiles or shingles before the wind finds them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does first-rain prep matter so much in Southern California?",
    a: "Homes here go dry for months at a time, so gutters fill with dust and debris, soil compacts, and grading issues go unnoticed until the season's first real storm. Cleaning gutters, checking the roof, and confirming the yard still slopes away from the foundation in October and November is what keeps that first storm from causing damage.",
