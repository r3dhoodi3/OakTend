const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does an electrical panel upgrade cost?",
    a: "An electrical panel upgrade typically runs about $1,500 to $4,000. Where you land depends mostly on the amperage you move to, whether the meter or service wiring also needs upgrading, the permit and inspection, and the electrician's labor. Moving from 100 amp to 200 amp service costs more than a straight like-for-like panel swap.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do I actually need a panel upgrade?",
    a: "Common triggers are adding an EV charger, building an ADU, going solar, or running an aging or overloaded panel that trips often. Older 100-amp panels can run short on capacity for a modern home with a heat pump, EV charger, and other large loads. Some older panels from brands with known safety problems are also frequently recommended for replacement. A licensed electrician can tell you whether your current service can carry what you want to add.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should I go with 100 amp or 200 amp?",
    a: "Most modern homes are served by 200-amp panels, and 200 amp is the common target when you are upgrading, especially if you plan to add an EV charger, heat pump, or solar. A 100-amp service can be fine for a smaller home with modest electrical needs, but it can run short once you stack several large loads. An electrician sizes the service to your home's real and planned loads.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit to upgrade my electrical panel?",
    a: "Electrical work like a panel or service upgrade generally requires a permit and an inspection, and the utility usually has to coordinate disconnecting and reconnecting the service. Your electrician typically handles the permit. Confirm one is being pulled, since a permitted, inspected upgrade leaves a clean record. Check with your city's building department for the exact requirement.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does hiring a licensed electrician matter for panel work?",
    a: "A panel upgrade involves the main service connection and carries real shock and fire risk if it is done wrong. A licensed electrician is trained and accountable for the work, pulls the required permit, and gets it inspected. A panel upgrade needs a permit, so California's small-job exception for unlicensed workers does not apply to it at any price. Hire a licensed electrical contractor (CSLB class C-10) and check the license at cslb.ca.gov. A permitted job protects you at resale and with your insurer.",

            <li>
              <strong>Adding an EV charger.</strong> A Level 2 charger is a

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Building an ADU.</strong> A second unit adds significant
              demand and often needs more service capacity.

            <li>
              <strong>Going solar.</strong> Some solar and battery installs
              require a 200-amp panel or a specific bus rating.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>An aging or overloaded panel.</strong> Older 100-amp
              panels can run short for a modern home, and panels that trip
              often or come from brands with known safety problems are
              frequently recommended for replacement.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Amperage is the size of your home&apos;s electrical service. Many
            older homes have 100-amp service, which can be fine for a smaller
            home with modest needs. Most modern homes run 200-amp service, and
            200 amp is the usual target when you upgrade, especially if you are
            planning an EV charger, a heat pump, or solar. The right answer is
            not automatic; an electrician sizes the service to your home&apos;s
            real and planned loads rather than to a rule of thumb.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Electrical work like a panel or service upgrade generally requires a
            permit and an inspection, and the utility usually has to coordinate
            disconnecting and reconnecting the service. This is not a job to
            hand to an unlicensed handyperson. The work touches the main service
            connection and carries real shock and fire risk if it is done
            wrong.

            A licensed electrician is trained and accountable for the work,
            pulls the required permit, and gets it inspected. A panel upgrade
            needs a permit, so California&apos;s small-job exception for
            unlicensed workers does not apply to it at any price. Hire a

            An Orange County note
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Orange County homeowners are upgrading panels more often lately,
            largely because of EV chargers, ADUs, and solar plus battery
            installs. Many neighborhoods have older housing stock still on
            100-amp service, so a panel upgrade is a common first step before
            adding any of those. Permit specifics and utility coordination vary
            by city and by whether Southern California Edison or your local
            utility serves your address, so confirm the process locally before
            you schedule work.
