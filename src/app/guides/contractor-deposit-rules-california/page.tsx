const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much can a contractor legally ask for up front in California?",
    a: "For a home improvement contract, California law caps the down payment at $1,000 or 10 percent of the contract price, whichever is less. So on a $25,000 remodel the down payment is capped at $1,000, not 10 percent, because $1,000 is the smaller number. On a $6,000 job, 10 percent is $600, and that is the cap because it is smaller than $1,000. This comes from Business and Professions Code section 7159.5.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the down payment cap apply to every contractor job?",
    a: "The cap applies to home improvement contracts, which are the residential repair and improvement jobs most homeowners hire for. There are limited exceptions in the law, and the rules can work differently for things like new home construction. If you are unsure whether your job qualifies, ask the contractor to point to where the down payment sits in the written contract, since the required contract language spells the cap out.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a written contract required for home improvement work in California?",
    a: "Yes. A home improvement contract must be in writing and signed when the total price, including labor and materials, exceeds $500. A contractor who asks you to skip the written contract on a job over that amount is not following the law, and a written contract is your main protection if something goes wrong.",
  },
  {
    q: "When does a contractor in California need a license?",
    a: "As of January 1, 2025, a contractor's license is required for work where the combined labor and materials come to $1,000 or more. Below that, an unlicensed person can do the work only if it needs no building permit and they hire no employees or helpers, and a job cannot be split into smaller pieces to stay under the limit. Any advertisement by an unlicensed person has to say they are not licensed. This change came from Assembly Bill 2622.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should I do if a contractor demands a large cash deposit?",
    a: "Treat it as a warning sign. Pressure to pay a big deposit, to pay in cash, or to start before anything is in writing are all red flags. Slow down, get the scope and the payment schedule in writing, keep the down payment within the legal cap, and keep a record of every payment and message. If it still feels wrong, you are free to walk away and hire someone else.",

            The down payment cap
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            California law caps the down payment on a home improvement contract.
            Under Business and Professions Code section 7159.5, the down payment
            may not exceed <strong>$1,000 or 10 percent of the contract price,
            whichever is less</strong>. The required contract language even
            spells this out in bold type. A couple of examples:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5 leading-relaxed">
            <li>
              On a <strong>$25,000</strong> kitchen remodel, 10 percent would be
              $2,500, so the cap is the smaller number: <strong>$1,000</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              On a <strong>$6,000</strong> job, 10 percent is $600, which is
              less than $1,000, so the cap is <strong>$600</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            If a contractor asks for more than that up front on a home
            improvement job, they are asking for more than the law allows.

            Progress payments should track the work
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            After the down payment, payments should follow the work, not run
            ahead of it. A fair payment schedule ties each payment to progress
            you can see, so what you have paid never gets far ahead of what has
            actually been built. The rule of thumb is simple: never pay the full
            price up front, and never let your payments outpace the completed
            work. Holding money back until the job is truly done is your
            leverage to get problems fixed.

            What a home improvement contract must include
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            In California, a home improvement job over <strong>$500</strong> in
            combined labor and materials requires a written contract, signed
            before work begins. A proper contract generally includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5 leading-relaxed">
            <li>The contractor&apos;s name, address, and license number.</li>
            <li>A clear description of the work and the materials to be used.</li>
            <li>The total contract price.</li>
            <li>The down payment and a payment schedule tied to progress.</li>
            <li>Start and expected completion dates.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A signed, written contract is your main protection. Verbal deals are
            hard to enforce, and any later change to the work should go in
            writing too.

            When a contractor needs a license
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            As of January 1, 2025, California requires a contractor&apos;s
            license for work where the combined labor and materials come to{" "}
            <strong>$1,000 or more</strong>. This came from Assembly Bill 2622,
            which raised the old $500 threshold. Below $1,000, an unlicensed
            person can do the work only if all of the following are true:
          </p>
          <ul className="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5 leading-relaxed">

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            An unlicensed person advertising for work also has to state that

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            These are state rules, so they apply the same way in every Orange
            County city and in the unincorporated areas: the $1,000 or 10
            percent down payment cap, the written contract over $500, and the
            license requirement at $1,000. A contractor based in Anaheim and
            one based in San Clemente are bound by the same Business and
            Professions Code.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            What changes locally is the permit, and the permit changes the
            license rule. The Contractors State License Board says anyone who
            contracts for a job that requires a building permit must hold a
            valid license, whatever the price. So the small-job exemption
            never covers work your city requires a permit for, even when the
            quote is under $1,000. Each city sets its own permit rules and
            fees, so ask your building department what your job needs before
            you sign.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            The law also says a contractor may not collect payment for work
