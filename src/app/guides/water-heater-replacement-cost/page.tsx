const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to replace a water heater?",
    a: "Nationally, a typical water heater replacement runs about $1,200 to $3,500. Where you land in that range depends mostly on whether you're replacing like-for-like or switching to tankless, gas vs. electric, the tank's capacity, and whether venting or plumbing needs to change.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a tankless water heater worth the extra cost?",
    a: "It depends on how long you'll stay in the home and how much hot water you use. Tankless units cost more upfront and often need bigger gas or electrical service, but they last longer and heat water only on demand. A standard tank costs less to install and is simpler to service, which is why most replacements are still tank-for-tank.",
  },
  {
    q: "When should I repair instead of replace a water heater?",
    a: "Repair usually makes sense for a younger unit with one clear problem, such as a bad thermostat, heating element, or pilot assembly. Replacement usually makes more sense once the tank itself is leaking, the unit is near or past its typical 11-year lifespan, or you're already paying for more than one repair.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does hard water affect a water heater in Orange County?",
    a: "Much of Orange County has moderately hard water, and hard water speeds up sediment buildup inside a tank. That sediment layer sits between the burner or element and the water, so the unit works harder and can wear out sooner than the typical range above. Flushing the tank on a regular schedule helps slow that buildup.",

            Tank vs. tankless
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A standard tank water heater keeps a set volume of hot water ready
            to go, costs less to buy and install, and is the simplest to
            service, but it takes up a closet&apos;s worth of space and can run out
            of hot water during heavy use. A tankless unit heats water only as
            you use it, takes up far less room, and typically lasts longer,
            but it costs more upfront, sometimes needs bigger gas or
            electrical service to keep up with demand, and is a bit more
            involved to install and maintain.

            When repair beats replacement
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A water heater has a typical working life of about 11 years. If
            yours is younger than that and the problem is something specific,
            like a faulty thermostat, heating element, or pilot assembly, a
            repair is usually the cheaper and faster fix. Replacement tends to
            make more sense once the tank itself is leaking (tanks don&apos;t
            get patched), the unit is at or past its typical lifespan, or
            you&apos;re facing a second repair on the same unit within a short
            span.

            An Orange County note

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Much of Orange County has moderately hard water, and hard water
            speeds up mineral and sediment buildup inside a tank. That layer
            of sediment sits between the burner or heating element and the
            water, so the unit works harder to do the same job, which can
            shorten its working life below the typical range above. Flushing
            the tank on a regular schedule (see our{" "}
