// a plan is first generated (so ten tasks don't all land on day one), not
// real-world recurrence intervals, and presenting them as such would be
// dishonest. Instead each cadence below is standard, widely published

            <strong>HVAC filters</strong> are the easiest task to skip and one
            of the cheapest ways to protect an expensive system: check monthly,
            replace every 1 to 3 months depending on the filter and household.{" "}
            <strong>Water heater flushes</strong>, once a year, clear out the
            sediment that otherwise makes the unit work harder and wear out
            sooner.{" "}
            <strong>AC service</strong>, once a year and ideally before the
            season you need it most, catches small problems, like a low
            refrigerant charge or a failing capacitor, while they&apos;re still
            cheap to fix.{" "}
            <strong>Gutter cleaning</strong>, twice a year, keeps water moving
            away from the roofline and foundation instead of backing up and
            causing damage somewhere it&apos;s expensive to fix.
