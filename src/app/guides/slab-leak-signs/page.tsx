const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What are the signs of a slab leak?",
    a: "The most common signs are a warm or hot spot on the floor, a water bill that jumps without a clear reason, the sound of running water when every faucet and appliance is off, and in more advanced cases, damp carpet, a musty smell, or cracks in the flooring or slab itself.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does a slab leak repair cost?",
    a: "It depends mostly on where the leak sits and how it has to be accessed. A spot repair through a reachable section of slab is usually the cheapest option, a reroute costs more because it involves running new pipe through the attic or walls, and a full repipe is the biggest job since it replaces every supply line at once. Because access and pipe length vary so much from house to house, we don't quote a number here: a licensed plumber can give you one once they've located the leak.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are my repair options for a slab leak?",
    a: "At a high level, the main options are a spot repair (opening the slab at the leak to fix that one section of pipe), a reroute (abandoning the damaged line and running a new one through the attic or walls instead of back through the slab), or a full repipe (replacing all the home's supply lines at once, usually through the attic). A licensed plumber can tell you which fits your situation after locating the leak.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a slab leak an emergency?",
    a: "Treat it as an emergency if you see active water pooling, water is coming up through the flooring, or you can't stop the flow at your main shutoff valve. A slow leak with just a warm spot and a rising water bill is worth addressing quickly, but it usually isn't a same-hour emergency the way active flooding is.",
  },
  {
    q: "How can I check for a slab leak myself?",
    a: "Use your water meter. The EPA's WaterSense program suggests reading the meter, using no water at all for two hours, and reading it again: if the number changed, you probably have a leak somewhere. It also says that if a family of four uses more than 12,000 gallons in a winter month, there could be a serious leak. The test does not tell you where the leak is, so a plumber still has to locate it.",

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            A slab leak is a leak in a water line running underneath your
            home&apos;s concrete foundation. Because the pipe is hidden, the signs
            tend to show up somewhere else first: a spot on the floor that&apos;s
            noticeably warm (usually a hot water line), a water bill that
            climbs without a clear explanation, or the sound of running water
            when every faucet, toilet, and appliance in the house is off. As
            a leak progresses, you may also notice damp or discolored carpet
            and flooring, a musty smell in one area, low water pressure, or
            cracks in the flooring or slab.

            Age is why this guide exists. The Census Bureau&apos;s 2024
            American Community Survey puts about 12 percent of Orange
            County&apos;s housing units in the 1950s, 19 percent in the 1960s,
            and 22 percent in the 1970s, so about half the county&apos;s homes
            are now roughly 50 to 75 years old. In the tract homes of those
            decades, from Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach to Garden
            Grove, Anaheim, and Santa Ana, copper water lines were commonly
            run under or through the concrete slab rather than through walls
            or an attic.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            InterNACHI&apos;s life expectancy chart gives copper water lines
            50 to 70 years, so original pipe from the 1960s is now inside that
            window. Decades of contact with concrete and soil, along with the
            normal expansion and contraction of a hot water line, make pinhole
            leaks more likely than in homes with more accessible plumbing.
            It&apos;s a pattern of the era and the construction method, not a
            reflection of how well any one home has been cared for.

            You can test for a hidden leak before calling anyone. The
            EPA&apos;s WaterSense program suggests reading your water meter,
            using no water at all for two hours, and reading it again. If the

            also says that if a family of four uses more than 12,000 gallons
            in a winter month, there could be a serious leak. The test does
            not tell you where the leak is, so a plumber still has to locate
            it, but it tells you whether the warm spot or the high bill is
            worth chasing.

          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Once a plumber locates the leak, the usual options are a{" "}
            <strong>spot repair</strong> (opening the slab just at the leak
            and fixing that section of pipe), a{" "}
            <strong>reroute</strong> (capping the damaged line and running a

            home&apos;s supply lines at once, typically through the attic, which
            is often considered once a home has had more than one slab leak).
            Which one makes sense depends on the pipe&apos;s condition elsewhere
            in the home, not just the single leak that got noticed.
