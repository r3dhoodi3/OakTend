const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How much does a bathroom remodel cost in Orange County?",
    a: "In Orange County, a full bathroom remodel typically runs about $25,000 to $60,000. A guest or hall bath that keeps its existing layout tends to land lower, while a master bathroom usually falls around $40,000 to $50,000, and a luxury remodel with moved plumbing and custom finishes can run $60,000 and up. That is roughly double the national average of around $12,000, mostly because of California labor, permitting, and material costs.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the cost per square foot to remodel a bathroom in OC?",
    a: "A standard Orange County bathroom remodel typically runs about $150 to $200 per square foot. Premium work with custom tile, higher-end fixtures, and layout changes can push past $300 per square foot. Because bathrooms are small, a high per-square-foot figure still adds up quickly given how much plumbing and tile work fits into a compact space.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a permit to remodel a bathroom in Orange County?",
    a: "It depends on the work. Purely cosmetic updates like paint, a new vanity that reuses the existing plumbing, or new flooring generally do not need a permit. Once you move or add plumbing, change electrical, or alter the layout, most OC cities generally require one. Thresholds vary by city, so check with your local building department before work starts.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does a contractor need a license for a bathroom remodel in California?",
    a: "In California, a contractor needs a CSLB license for any job of $1,000 or more, counting labor and materials combined, as of January 1, 2025. The under-$1,000 exemption does not apply if the job needs any permit, if the person hires helpers, or if a larger job is split into smaller contracts. Most bathroom remodels clear $1,000 easily, so you should confirm a valid license.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is a bathroom remodel worth it at resale?",
    a: "A mid-range bathroom remodel tends to return a larger share of its cost at resale than a high-end one, though neither typically pays for itself dollar for dollar. The stronger case is usually daily use and not deferring a bathroom that is leaking or failing, since those problems only get more expensive the longer they wait.",

            <li>
              <strong>Layout changes.</strong> Moving the toilet, shower, or

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tile and materials.</strong> Standard porcelain costs
              far less than custom stone or intricate patterns that take more
              labor to set.

            <li>
              <strong>Fixtures and finishes.</strong> The vanity, faucets,

              <strong>Labor.</strong> In a California bathroom budget, labor

            Hiring in California: what to check
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            California requires a CSLB contractor license for any job of{" "}
            <strong>$1,000 or more</strong>, counting labor and materials
            together, as of January 1, 2025. That number went up from $500,
            so many sites still quote the old figure. The under-$1,000
            exemption does not apply if the job needs any permit, if the
            person hires helpers, or if a larger job is split into smaller
            contracts. Most bathroom remodels clear $1,000, so confirm a valid
            license before signing.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            On permits, purely cosmetic work like paint, flooring, or a
            like-for-like vanity swap generally does not need one. Once you
            change plumbing, electrical, or the layout, most OC cities
            generally require a permit. Swapping lighting or a bath fan can
            also trigger California energy-code (Title 24) compliance, while
            simple like-for-like repairs generally do not. Thresholds vary by
            city, so check with your local building department before work
            starts.
