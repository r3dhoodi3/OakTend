// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Mirrors src/components/pro/SetupChecklist.tsx
// (investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md): PERKS.map() used to render six
// description-heavy cards or list rows inline inside a Server Component, and on this
// page that block sits at (or past) the point where React Flight's 3200-byte-per-row
// serialization budget runs out. Past that budget Flight defers every further element
// it meets into its own row, which Fizz then streams as an out-of-order segment - a
// <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's own markup plus a late $RS(...) fill
// script, instead of the one clean top-level hole a healthy page has. That is the exact
// shape DBG3 found on /pro (eight holes, chained through SetupChecklist's <ul>) and it
// matches the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration failure reported on /pro/plus.
//
// As a client module this whole perks block becomes ONE client reference in the parent
// page's Flight payload, with plain-data props - so there is nothing left at the tail of
// the row for Flight to defer. No interactivity here; this is a streaming-shape fix.
//
// 2026-08-30 follow-up: the icons used to cross the boundary as already-rendered leaf
// ELEMENTS (`icon: <p.icon className="h-5 w-5" />`), which put six elements back inside
// this component's props. Deep in a props object is still inside the page's Flight row,
// so once the row passed 3200 bytes the LAST perk's icon was deferred on its own -
// measured live as `"icon":"$L32"` on /pro/plus. The icon is a NAME now and this module
// renders it, so the props carry nothing but strings. The rendered markup is unchanged:
// the two class strings below are the two the page used to pre-render, picked by the
// same `variant` that already decided the layout.
