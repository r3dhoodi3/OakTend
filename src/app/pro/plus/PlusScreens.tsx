// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/app/pro/leads/LeadsBoard.tsx, src/app/pro/chats/ChatsView.tsx and
// src/app/pro/help/HelpView.tsx, investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then has to stream each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// /pro/plus still carried two deferrals after PerksList moved out: measured
// live, the pitch branch chopped the LAST perk's icon element out of
// PerksList's props and then the closing "Questions about billing?" line -
// both past byte ~4550 of the page row. The icon half is fixed in PerksList
// itself (it takes a name now, not an element); this file is the other half.
//
// Every branch of the page renders through one of the components below, so the
// page's own Flight row is a single client reference carrying plain data -
// strings, booleans and server-action references - with no element after it to
// defer. All four branches live here for that reason: leaving one behind in
// the page would put server markup back in that row.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive and nothing is newly computed on the
// client. ProPlanToggle, ConfirmSubmit and next/link were already client
// components; AutoRenewalTerms and PerksList are pure markup over pure data.
// Anything that reads the clock or the locale - the renewal date, the trial
// end date, the cancellation copy that names them - is still resolved on the
// server and arrives here as a finished string, so hydration cannot disagree
// with SSR about it.

          to, but on the free trial those two are held back: the wallet credit
          needs a paid invoice and the deposit match needs an "active" row (see
          creditDepositSession in the Stripe webhook). A pre-purchase visitor
          about to start a trial has no subscription row yet, so this must show
          for a trial-eligible visitor as well, not only a "trialing" row. A
          returning member (trialEligible false) starts paying right away, so
          their perks are on from day one and they don't see this. */}
