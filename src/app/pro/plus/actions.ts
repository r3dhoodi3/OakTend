  // shortcut in one, the yearly card in the other - and start both: both read

  // subscriptions on two different Stripe customers. The webhook's
  // upsert-by-(user_id, side) keeps ONE subscriptions row; the other survived
  // as an orphan with no row, no in-app cancel button, and - because Checkout
  // with customer:undefined mints a fresh customer per session - no customer
  // anyone had on file, so even the billing portal could not reach it. It
  // billed at trial end forever.
  //
  // The fix is the exact one the Plus side uses (startPlusCheckoutAction) and
  // the one the Pro intro coupon already uses below: atomically claim a
  // promo_claims row before the Stripe session is created. Its PK is
  // (user_id, promo_key), so claim_promo's "on conflict do nothing ... return
  // found" lets exactly ONE of N racing requests win; every other one falls
  // through to a charged-today checkout with the disclosure and consent record
  // built from the same `freeTrial` value, so nothing on screen promises free
  // days that are not coming. claim_promo is service_role-only, hence the admin
  // client. The webhook releases an abandoned reservation (expired session, or
  // a subscription landing canceled/incomplete_expired without going live) and
  // stamps a completed one converted, so a legit pro who bails keeps their one
  // trial. `trial_reserved` in the session metadata is how the webhook knows
  // which attempt holds it.
  //
  // A FAILED RPC MEANS NO TRIAL. Free days are the thing being farmed, so an
  // unreadable counter must never be a way to get a second one. And when the

  // resume the open session, take over a dead one, or stand down (fail closed).

  // RESERVE the promo before Stripe ever sees a discount - don't just check

  // of those only reflect state the webhook writes AFTER a checkout
  // completes. Two checkouts opened back-to-back (two tabs, a replay script)
  // both read "not claimed yet", both got the coupon, and both eventually
  // triggered the wallet credit (idempotent per INVOICE, but N concurrent
  // subscriptions mint N distinct invoice ids) - net: pay $9.99xN, collect
  // $10xN in spendable credit.
  //
  // The fix: atomically claim the promo_claims row (user_id, promo_key) HERE,
  // synchronously, before the Stripe session is created. promo_claims' PK is
  // (user_id, promo_key) (migration 0071), so claim_promo()'s
  // "on conflict do nothing ... return found" makes a second concurrent call
  // for the same user return false - only ONE of N racing requests can ever
  // win the reservation; every other one falls straight through to full
  // price, no coupon attached. claim_promo is service_role-only (revoked
  // from authenticated/anon in 0071 on purpose), hence the admin client.
  //
  // A reservation that's never spent - checkout abandoned, tab closed,
  // payment declined - is released by the webhook (checkout.session.expired
  // for an abandoned session; customer.subscription.{updated,deleted}
  // landing on canceled/incomplete_expired for a subscription that never
  // actually went live) so a legit user who bails on checkout keeps their one
  // intro to spend on a later, real attempt. `intro_reserved` in the session
  // metadata below is how the webhook recognizes which specific attempt
  // holds the reservation.
  //
  // The two original guards still run first, as cheap pre-checks that skip
  // the Stripe coupon lookup + RPC entirely when we already know the answer:
  // `!existing` off the current subscriptions row, and
  // `!hasClaimedPromo(...)`, the lifecycle-independent ledger check that
  // still holds if a canceled row is ever pruned. Neither is what actually
  // enforces one-per-user anymore - claim_promo's primary key is - but
  // keeping both avoids regressing anyone the 0071 backfill missed.
  //
  // `!freeTrial` is the new first gate, and today it is never satisfied: the
  // trial and the intro coupon are mutually exclusive. Stripe treats a
  // duration:"once" coupon as used once the first invoice FINALIZES, and a
  // trial start finalizes a $0 invoice, so attaching both would burn the $20
  // off on nothing and bill full price at trial end - more than the buyer was
  // shown, which is exactly what ROSCA and the California Automatic Renewal
  // Law forbid. Everything below stays in place (and stays correct) for the
  // day the trial is switched off; it is not dead-lettered.
  //
  // A ROW THAT ALREADY EXISTS IS NOT ALWAYS A SPENT OFFER, which is the
  // homeowner side's live bug in the same shape (see startPlusCheckoutAction
  // and checkoutReservation.ts). A reservation held by a checkout the pro
  // opened and backed out of sits in the ledger until Stripe expires the
  // session, up to 24 hours later - and until then every retry both loses the
  // offer AND changes the request body under an unchanged idempotency key,
  // which Stripe refuses outright. So a lost claim now asks Stripe what became
  // of the session that holds it: resume it, take it over if it is dead, or
  // stand down. Standing down is the fail-closed answer, so two tabs at once
