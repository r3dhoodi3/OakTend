//
// Both cadences start on the same free trial, so the trial stays the headline
// on the checkout block below and the price is what it steps up to. Charged
// amounts live in the checkout action; PRO_PLAN keeps display and billing in
// sync.
//
// `trialEligible` mirrors the exact signal startProCheckoutAction uses to grant

//
// PHONE DISCLOSURE: TWO COPIES OF AutoRenewalTerms, ONE PER BREAKPOINT.
// (The full reasoning lives here rather than beside each block: a long comment
// wedged between the disclosure and the button it belongs to is exactly what
// the autoRenewalPlacement test refuses, and rightly - the two must stay
// within a screenful of each other in the source as well as on the page.)
// Every checkout form here starts a Stripe checkout, so the recurring terms
// must be on screen next to its button before any billing information is
// collected (ROSCA 15 U.S.C. 8403(1)) and in visual proximity to the request
// for consent (Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code 17602(a)(1)).
// Same treatment the homeowner PlanToggle got: each checkout form renders the
// block twice, once inside a `sm:hidden` <details> that starts CLOSED and once
// inside a `max-sm:hidden` div that renders exactly as it always did. On a
// 390px screen the full block ran about a third of a screen and pushed the
// button it belongs to below the fold.
//
// What is collapsed is the ITEMIZED version, never the material terms. The
// one-line summary (PLAN_BILLING below) stays on screen unconditionally,
// directly beside the button, which is what
// ROSCA 15 U.S.C. 8403(1) and Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code 17602(a)(1) are about:
// material terms disclosed before billing information is collected, in visual
// proximity to the request for consent. One tap opens the rest, and it is
// inside the same form as the button either way.
//
// Two elements rather than one because `open` is a boolean attribute no media
// query can drive, and flipping it from JS on mount would either flash or
// mismatch hydration.
//
// THE STORED CONSENT RECORD IS UNAFFECTED. The billing-terms text in the
// Stripe metadata is built SERVER-SIDE by startProCheckoutAction from
// src/lib/billingTerms.ts, off the posted cadence, never from what this
// component rendered.
//
// PHONE TEXT SIZES. Every 10px and 11px line below carries a `max-sm:`
// override up to 12px or 14px. Desktop keeps the original class, so sm and up
// renders byte-identical to before.

// One plain sentence per cadence: what is charged, when, and how to stop it.
// Every number read from PRO_PLAN / formatUsd / yearlySavings above rather
// than typed. This is the line that stays visible on a phone while the
