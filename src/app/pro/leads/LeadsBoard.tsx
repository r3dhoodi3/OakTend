// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/app/pro/chats/ChatsView.tsx and src/components/pro/SetupChecklist.tsx,
// investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then has to stream each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// /pro/leads was the worst of them: measured on a pro with eight assigned
// leads, the page's own Flight row carried THIRTY-ONE deferred references and
// the served document had eight nested holes and nine $RS scripts. Every card
// in every one of the four lists (Asked for you, Open jobs, Your jobs,
// Applications) was another element past the budget.
//
// As one client module the whole board becomes a SINGLE client reference in
// the page's payload carrying plain data - ids, strings, numbers, booleans and
// labels that were already formatted on the server - so there is no element
// left anywhere in that row for Flight to defer. All four sections live in
// here for that reason: leaving any one of them behind in the page would put
// an element after this component's props, which is exactly where the budget
// has already run out.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive, and nothing is newly computed on the
// client. ApplyJobButton, DirectRequestActions, JobPhotoStrip, JobStatusSelect,
// OpenChatButton and next/link were already client components; everything else
// is static markup rendered from props. Anything that depends on the clock or
// the locale (the aging fee, the posted-ago line, the intro price) is still
// resolved on the server and arrives here as a finished string, so hydration
// cannot disagree with SSR about it.
