// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/app/pro/chats/ChatsView.tsx and src/app/pro/leads/LeadsBoard.tsx,
// investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then streams each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// /pro/crm measured 11 deferrals on the page row, 4 nested holes and 5 $RS
// scripts for a pro with real jobs: the stage tiles, the client cards, the
// "Track from your jobs" rows and the Pro teaser cards are all lists, and each
// item past the budget was another deferral.
//
// As one client module the whole page body becomes a SINGLE client reference
// carrying plain data, so there is no element left in that row to defer. The
// two server actions (addClientAction, trackLeadAction) are imported straight
// from the "use server" module, which a client component may do - that keeps
// them out of the props entirely rather than adding two more serialized
// references to the row.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive, and nothing is newly computed on the
// client: the follow-up dates and the "tracked on" line read the clock and the
// locale, so they are still resolved on the server and arrive as strings.
