// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/app/pro/leads/LeadsBoard.tsx, src/app/pro/chats/ChatsView.tsx,
// src/app/pro/help/HelpView.tsx, src/app/pro/billing/BillingView.tsx and
// src/app/pro/business/BusinessView.tsx, investigated in
// scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then has to stream each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// Making SetupChecklist a client component (DBG3's first fix) took /pro from
// eight nested holes to one. It did not take the DEFERRALS to zero: measured
// live on 2026-08-30 the page row still cut the entire two-column lower half
// of the page - everything from "Asked for you" down - into a row of its own,
// because the greeting, the quick actions and the three tool tiles above it
// had already spent the budget by byte ~4590. The lower half is not the
// problem; whatever renders after the budget runs out is.
//
// As one client module the whole body becomes a SINGLE client reference in the
// page's payload carrying plain data, so there is no element left anywhere in
// that row for Flight to defer.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive and nothing is newly computed on the
// client. LeadsRealtime, ChatDrawer, ClearOnboardingDraft, DirectRequestCard,
// SetupChecklist, ProNudge, ProChip, LiveUnreadBadge and next/link were
// already client components; the rest is static markup rendered from props.
// Everything that reads the clock or the locale - the greeting's time of day,
// the subtitle's counts, each direct request's posted-ago line - is resolved
// on the server and arrives here as a finished string, so hydration cannot
// disagree with SSR about it.
