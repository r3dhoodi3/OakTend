// Source-shape guards for the pro shell.
//
// These are not style rules. The pro shell is the one shell in the app that
// ever put a <Suspense> boundary in the MIDDLE of its own markup (around
// AppGuideMount), and that boundary was the cause of the intermittent
// `Minified React error #418` plus
// `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentNode') at $RS` that only
// ever showed on /pro pages. A mid-shell boundary streams as
// `<!--$?--><template id="B:n"></template><!--/$-->` and React's own reveal
// script rewrites those three nodes in place when the server resolves it; on a
// pro page the shell flushes long before that read finishes, so the rewrite
// lands in the few milliseconds the browser spends hydrating the shell around
// it. When it does, React loses its place in the child list of the shell's
// root <div>, throws the host-element mismatch at <main>, client-renders the
// whole root, and the page-content fill script that runs afterwards finds no
// <template> left to insert before - which is the $RS TypeError.
//
// The homeowner shell (src/app/(app)/layout.tsx) has always mounted the same
// component with no boundary, by awaiting getUserProfile() at the top so the
// read inside AppGuideMount is a per-request cache hit. The pro shell does the
// same now, and these tests are here so it stays that way.
