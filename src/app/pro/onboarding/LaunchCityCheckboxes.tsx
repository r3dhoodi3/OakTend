// The service-area question: exactly the cities OakTend serves, checkboxes
// because a pro can serve several. Lives in signup AND in the profile editor
// (src/app/pro/profile/PublicProfileForm.tsx), which posts the identical field
// names to the identical action. See ./launchCities.ts for why one answer
// writes service_area, serves_orange_county, and launch_cities.
//
// SHAPE: since 0129 the launch area is all of Orange County, 36 names, and 36
// checkboxes is a wall on a phone. So the default answer is one row, "All of
// Orange County", checked for a new pro. Under it sits a collapsed "Choose
// specific cities instead" link; opening it unchecks "All" and shows the
// cities in four regional groups (LAUNCH_CITY_GROUPS). Checking "All" again
// collapses the list. The two states are one boolean (`all`): the list is open
// exactly when "All" is unchecked, so there is no way to be looking at city
// boxes that the form is about to ignore.
//
// WHAT GETS POSTED: "All of Orange County" is not a value. While it is checked
// this component posts a hidden `service_cities` input for EVERY launch city,
// so saveCompanyAction and selectLaunchCities see the same field they always
// did and need no notion of the shortcut. The wizard's own step check
// (./wizardSteps.ts, which counts service_cities) is satisfied the same way.
//
// AT LEAST ONE REQUIRED, natively: with "All" unchecked, `required` sits on
// EVERY city box while zero are checked, so the browser refuses the submit and
// points at the field; checking any one drops `required` from all of them. No
// custom validation layer, and saveCompanyAction still enforces the same rule
// server-side for anything that isn't a browser.
//
// `requireOne` is the one escape hatch, for the onboarding wizard: there this
// fieldset lives on a step panel that is `hidden` while the pro is on another
// step, and a `required` control inside a hidden panel blocks the submit with a
// browser message that cannot be shown or focused. The wizard passes false while
// its city step is off screen and runs the same "at least one" rule itself
// (see ./wizardSteps.ts). Defaults to true, so the profile editor and any other
// caller keep the native behavior unchanged.
//
// LAYOUT: rows are at least 44px tall on a phone (max-sm:) with the box and
// the name both inside the label, so the whole row is the tap target. City
// boxes sit in a two-column grid (single column only on the narrowest phones,
// where two columns would wrap a city name). No icons, no card chrome.
//
// The hidden marker is what tells saveCompanyAction this form actually asked
// the question, matching the missing-field-safe discipline the rest of that
// action uses: a form without the marker must never have its stored service
// area rewritten from an absent answer.
//
// `defaultCities` is what the profile editor passes so a returning pro sees
// their stored pick already checked (signup passes nothing). Nothing stored,
// or every city stored, starts as "All" checked and the list collapsed; a
// narrower pick starts with "All" unchecked and the list open on those boxes,
// so a pro who narrowed keeps their narrowing across an unrelated profile
// save. Anything that isn't a launch city is ignored here, and
// selectLaunchCities drops it server-side too, so a stale or hand-edited
// value can never pre-check a city OakTend doesn't serve. When "All" starts
// checked (nothing stored, or every city stored - the onboarding draft
// re-posts every city while a pro leaves "All" checked, so a resumed draft
// hits this same path), opening the disclosure starts every box unchecked
// rather than pre-checking all of them: there is no real narrowing to
// restore in that case, only a genuine partial pick is.

  // list underneath the disclosure must not seed from it: opening the

  // box pre-checked. Only a genuine partial pick (some but not all cities)
