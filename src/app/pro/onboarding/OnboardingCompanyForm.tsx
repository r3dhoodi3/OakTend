// So the submit deletes nothing, and the clearing happens on the far side of a
// save that actually worked: /pro renders ClearOnboardingDraft

            Server-side floor in saveCompanyAction (../actions.ts) requires
            pro_terms_ack on first-time company creation; this client-side
            required attribute is only the helpful early message (see the
            case 2 gate in ./wizardSteps.ts) - a hidden panel like this one
            still submits, so the real gate lives in the two places above,
            not here. TODO(legal): have counsel review this acknowledgment
            copy before launch. */}
