      {/* WAYS OUT. This page is a dead end for an account with a contractor
          stamp and no company row: every landing in the app resolves to it,
          and until Finish setup succeeds there is no row to resolve anywhere
          else. A save that keeps failing (a schema constraint, a CSLB timeout)
          therefore trapped a tester behind this one form, sign-out and back in
          included. So the two real answers sit under it, quietly:

          - a home to go back to, for someone who only wandered onto the pro
            side and has one already;
          - otherwise the honest question. It posts to the same guarded
            chooseRoleAction /welcome/role uses, which stamps homeowner and
            lands them on the claim-a-home wizard - and which still refuses to
            move an account that HAS a side, so this can only ever help
            someone who has built nothing yet.

          Sign out is repeated from the bare shell's header on purpose: this is
          where someone looks when they are stuck, and the header bar is off
          screen by the time they have scrolled to the end of the wizard. */}
