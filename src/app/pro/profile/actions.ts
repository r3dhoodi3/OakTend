// saveLogoAction, saveBannerAction, savePublicPageAction, licenseDisputeAction
// - carry assertProSideOpen(), because they are the pro product and the pro
// product is closed until the lawyer review lands.
//
// The four ACCOUNT-LEVEL ones deliberately do NOT: updatePasswordAction,
// updateEmailAction, signOutOthersAction and deleteAccountAction. They happen
// to live under /pro/profile, but they are the same account operations every
// homeowner has, and three of them are the ones somebody reaches for when
// something has gone wrong - a leaked password, a stolen session, a decision
// to leave. Blocking account DELETION in particular would be a privacy
// regression (it is the CCPA erasure path, src/lib/privacy.ts), not a preview
// feature. Preview mode closes a product; it does not take away somebody's
// control of their own account.

// Password re-verification is a brute-force surface: updatePasswordAction,
// updateEmailAction, and deleteAccountAction each take a current password and
// tell the caller whether it was right. Holding the session proves who they
// are, but a borrowed or hijacked one must not get unlimited guesses at the
// password behind it, and the typed-email delete confirmation shouldn't be
// infinitely retryable either. Same fixed-window limiter (migration 0068) and
// same shared bucket as the homeowner twin in src/app/(app)/account/actions.ts,
// and like it this bucket fails CLOSED (see passwordAttemptsExhausted): a
// limiter outage blocks rather than handing a borrowed session unlimited tries.
