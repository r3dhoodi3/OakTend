// The pro side's dedicated bug-report page. Every report is stored pending
// review (C7, 2026-09-07): a person reads it, and a report confirmed real can
// earn up to $15 in bonus lead credit, granted by hand after review - never
// automatically. Read src/lib/proFeedback.ts before touching any copy here:
// this is NOT a rating and NOT an app-store review, nothing on this page may
// use the word "rating" next to the credit, and the credit may never be tied
// to a store review. Paying for those is forbidden by App Store Review
// Guidelines 1.1.7 / 3.2.2 and Google Play policy, and the FTC treats an
// undisclosed incentivised review as deceptive.
