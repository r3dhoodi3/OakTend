// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/components/pro/SetupChecklist.tsx and src/app/pro/plus/PerksList.tsx,
// investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then has to stream each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// /pro/chats hit it in the conversation list: measured on a pro with eight
// real conversations, the page's Flight row carried EIGHT deferred references
// (six conversation rows plus the thread pane), because every <li> the map
// produced was another element past the budget. A fast local server usually
// resolves those rows before Fizz walks past them, so the templates only
// materialize under real network timing - which is why this reproduced live
// and not on localhost. The deferrals are the thing to count.
//
// As one client module the whole two-pane body becomes a SINGLE client
// reference in the page's payload with plain-data props (strings, booleans,
// and the server-action references LeadChat already took), so there is no
// element left anywhere in that row for Flight to defer. Both branches - the
// list and the open thread - live in here for that reason: leaving either one
// behind in the page would put an element after the list's ~4 kB of props,
// which is exactly where the budget has already run out.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive. AskOakTendRow, PhoneChatFrame, LeadChat
// and next/link were already client components; the rest is static markup that
// used to be rendered on the server and is now rendered from plain props.
