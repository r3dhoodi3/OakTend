  // Stripe Connect (Express) account, so every pro needs one before they can
  // send anything. Onboarding stays THREE STEPS: the account is created
  // silently here, and the pro is asked to finish it ("Add where you get
  // paid") later, from the nudge on pro Home or the Payouts row on
  // /pro/business.
  //
  // Three rules this call must never break, in order of importance:
  //   1. It must never throw. The company row already landed; a Stripe outage
  //      (or a dev machine with no STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, where @/lib/stripe's
  //      lazy proxy throws on first use) must not turn a finished signup into
  //      an error banner. ensureConnectAccount already returns {error} rather
  //      than throwing for every case it anticipates; the catch is for the
  //      ones it does not.
  //   2. It must never delay the redirect. after() runs it once the response
  //      is on its way, so the wizard finishes at exactly the speed it did
  //      before. Same import the leads page already uses (src/app/pro/leads).
  //   3. It must never change the flash or the redirect below.
  //
  // NOT in the 23505 double-submit branch above: that branch reaches here with
  // `error` still set, and newContractorId is NOT the row that actually landed
  // (the other request's row is), so it would create an account keyed to a
  // contractor id that does not exist. That pro gets their account on their
  // first visit to /pro/payouts instead. Not on the UPDATE (edit profile)
  // branch either - that pro already has one.
  //
  // AND NOT IN PREVIEW MODE (guardrail A4). This is the one Stripe call in the
  // app that nobody asks for - it happens silently when a wizard finishes - so
  // it is also the easiest one to forget. Creating a Connect Express account
  // registers a real business with Stripe; doing that while we are telling a
  // lawyer the contractor side is closed is exactly wrong, and unlike a
  // checkout it is not undone by flipping the flag back. The catch above would
  // have swallowed the stripe.ts throw into a log line and nobody would have
  // noticed, which is why this is an explicit skip rather than a reliance on
  // the backstop. Only internal accounts can reach saveCompanyAction in
  // preview at all (assertProSideOpen at the top of this action), and they get

// the SECURITY DEFINER charge_lead / choose_applicant flows that confirm
// payment), so it was removed rather than patched.
