// said hello. The owner asked for a home that "feels more homey", so the board

// lands on: what is waiting on them today, the two things they most often came
// here to do, their own numbers, and the setup they have not finished.

// the leads board already made, plus one small bounded message query for the
// "waiting on your reply" count. Nothing here is a slogan: every sentence is a
// count of something real, and when there is nothing, it says so.
