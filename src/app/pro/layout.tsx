          takeover in the middle of onboarding. Renders null once the account

          NO <Suspense> AROUND THIS (removed 2026-08-30), and it must not come
          back. It used to sit behind `<Suspense fallback={null}>` so its
          users-row read could not hold up the shell. That boundary was the one
          thing the pro shell had that the homeowner shell (which mounts the
          same component bare) did not - and it was the cause of the
          intermittent `Minified React error #418` plus
          `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parentNode') at $RS` that
          only ever showed on /pro pages.

          The mechanism: a Suspense boundary in the MIDDLE of the shell streams
          as `<!--$?--><template id="B:n"></template><!--/$-->`, and React's
          own reveal script rewrites those three nodes in place the moment the
          server resolves the boundary. On a pro page the shell flushes early
          (the layout's own reads are done) while this read is still in flight,
          so the rewrite lands in the same few milliseconds the client spends
          hydrating the shell around it. When it lands mid-hydration, React
          loses its place in the child list, throws the host-element mismatch
          (#418), client-renders the whole root, and the page-content fill
          script that runs after that has no `<template>` left to insert
          before - which is the `$RS` TypeError.

          BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT THIS BUYS. Measured on a local production build
          against a throwaway pro, hard-reloading the six pro routes: with the
          boundary, 3 failures in 36 loads; without it, 1 in 69 on the same
          build and 1 in 18 on the final one. It removes one of the two
          streamed boundaries the shell hydrates around, so the window shrinks,
          but it does NOT close it - the other boundary is the route segment's
          own (from pro/loading.tsx) and Next owns that one. The residual is a
          React 19.1.9 hydration-restart bug, captured by patching
          throwOnHydrationMismatch in the emitted React chunk: React re-enters
          <main> below with its module-level hydration cursor already pointing
          at <main>'s own first child, so the element cannot be re-claimed. The
          only app-level lever that removes the mechanism outright is to stop
          this shell flushing ahead of the page body at all (no pro
          loading.tsx anywhere, so there is no deferred boundary to reveal),
          and that is a product trade - skeleton now vs. a later first paint -
          that belongs to the owner, not to this file.

          Nothing is paid for removing it: getUserProfile() is React-cached per
          request and is already awaited in the Promise.all at the top of this
          layout, so the read here is a cache hit and the shell waits on
          nothing new. This is exactly how src/app/(app)/layout.tsx has always
          mounted it. */}
