// STREAMING FIX, not a behaviour change. Same treatment as
// src/app/pro/leads/LeadsBoard.tsx, src/app/pro/chats/ChatsView.tsx and
// src/app/pro/help/HelpView.tsx, investigated in scratchpad/debug-DBG3.md.
//
// React Flight defers any element it meets once the row it is serializing has
// passed a 3200-byte budget: it writes "$L<id>" in place and starts a fresh
// row for that element. Fizz then has to stream each of those rows as an
// out-of-order segment - a <template id="P:n"> hole nested inside the page's
// own markup plus a late $RS(...) script to fill it - and that hole chain is
// the shape that comes with the React #418 / "$RS ... parentNode" hydration
// failure reported on the pro pages.
//
// Moving Activity into its own client module (ActivityList.tsx) fixed the
// middle of the page but not the end of it: measured live on 2026-08-30 the
// page row still deferred ONE element, <ActivityList> itself, because the
// intro copy, the balances and the deposit section ahead of it had already
// spent the budget by byte ~4200. There is no "last element" fix for that -
// whatever renders last takes the deferral - so the whole body moves in here
// and the page's own row becomes a single client reference with plain data.
//
// Nothing here is newly interactive and nothing is newly computed on the
// client. Breadcrumbs, DepositForm, FadingBanner, ProUpgradeCta and
// ActivityList were already components of their own; the rest is static
// markup rendered from props. Everything that reads the clock or the locale -
// each activity row's timestamp, the dollar strings - is still resolved on
// the server and arrives as a finished string, so hydration cannot disagree
// with SSR about it.
