// Public contact form: no login required, so it needs its own spam defenses
// (a signed-in form, like account/help/SupportForm.tsx, gets those for free
// from requiring a session). Two of the three live here; the third, IP rate
// limiting, lives server-side in ./actions.ts where it can't be bypassed by
// skipping the client.
//
// Name / email / phone are prefilled when the visitor happens to be signed in
// (the page reads the session and passes them down), so a member who follows a
// legal-page link here does not retype what we already know.
//
// EVERY FIELD IS CONTROLLED, and that is load bearing rather than a style
// choice. React 19 RESETS a form automatically once the function passed to
// <form action> has finished - on the error return just as much as on success.
// With uncontrolled fields (defaultValue) that meant a visitor who wrote three
// paragraphs, forgot their email address and got "Please add an email or a
// phone number" back had the whole message wiped by the very submit that
// produced the message: verified live and locally on 2026-08-30, all four
// fields empty next to the error. React re-renders a controlled input from
// state straight after that reset, so holding the values here is what makes
// the reset a no-op and keeps what somebody typed on screen while they fix
// whatever the server complained about.
