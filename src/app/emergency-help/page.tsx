// signing in or claiming a property first, so this route lives OUTSIDE the
// auth-gated (app) group and is listed in the middleware public-paths allowlist
// (see src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts).
//
// It reuses the SAME content source (FLOWS) and the SAME PanicCard visual
// treatment as the in-app page, so the safety steps are never forked: edit the
// steps once in (app)/emergency/content.ts and both pages update. The only
// difference here is there's no saved-property context, so the per-property
// "your shutoff is here" photo (prepPhotoSrc / prepNote) is simply null and the
// generic static steps render on their own.
