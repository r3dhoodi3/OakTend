  // ?next= is caller-supplied on EVERY route through here - a Google sign-in
  // started from anywhere can carry next=/reset-password?step=update - so the
  // cookie would have been mintable by completing an ordinary sign-in with a
  // chosen query string, which is precisely the walk-up it exists to stop.
  // safeNextPath only proves the value is a relative path of ours; it says

  // oaktend_pwrecovery cookie that /reset-password requires before it will
  // render the "set a new password" form. It grants nothing else, and a forged
  // ?type=recovery on a link with no valid code never reaches the set, because
  // everything below is inside `if (code)` and the exchange has to succeed.
  //
  // OPERATOR NOTE (docs/SECURITY-OPS.md): this depends on the reset link
  // carrying type=recovery all the way to this route. If password reset ever
  // stops advancing past step one, that is the thing to check first - the
  // supported fix is to point the "Reset Password" email template at
