// Root: route signed-in users into the app, everyone else to the marketing-lite

//
// STAYS DYNAMIC, on its own merits rather than the root layout's (that no
// longer reads cookies - see src/app/layout.tsx). Two per-request reads sit
// above the markup and both are routing decisions, not decoration:
// searchParams.code catches a magic link that landed here instead of
// /auth/callback and forwards it, and auth.getUser() + getSides() sends a
// signed-in visitor to /pro or /dashboard. No per-request DATA feeds the
// landing markup itself - every list below is a plain in-function constant -
// so if those two redirects ever move (the code hand-off into middleware, the
// signed-in bounce into a client-side check), this page prerenders with no
// other work. Until then a revalidate export would be a no-op and force-static
// would silently break both redirects.
//
// AN ANONYMOUS VISITOR DOES NO NETWORK WORK AT ALL HERE, and every step of
// that is deliberate. This is the highest-traffic route in the product and the
// overwhelming majority of hits on it are signed out.
//
//   - the middleware does NOT check auth here. "/" is first in isPublicPath
//     (src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts), and updateSession returns before it
//     ever builds a Supabase client for a public path. That is on purpose and
//     documented there; do not "fix" it by removing "/" from that list.
//   - the page asks the CHEAPEST question first: does this request even carry
//     a Supabase auth cookie (hasAuthCookie, src/lib/authCookie.ts)? That is a
//     string test over cookie names - no client construction, no GoTrue
//     initialize/lock, no fetch. No such cookie means there is no session to
//     find, so nothing further is asked and the landing markup renders
//     straight away.
//   - only when a session could exist does it call getVerifiedUser(): the real
//     verification against Supabase's auth server, React-cache()-wrapped, so
//     getSides() -> getCurrentContractor() below reuses this one answer
//     instead of opening a second round trip of its own. A signed-in visitor
//     used to pay two sequential hops here before the redirect could even be
//     decided; now it is one.
//
// THE COOKIE CHECK IS NOT A TRUST DECISION. It can only ever skip work, never
// grant anything: no cookie means signed out, which is the answer an unforgeable
// check would also have produced. A cookie that IS present proves nothing and is
// believed for nothing - the verified call still decides. Nobody reaches the app
// through this page; they reach it through the redirect, and everything behind
// that redirect re-checks for itself.
