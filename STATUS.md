# OakTend status (2026-08-28 morning, written by Claude overnight)

Quick-read handoff. The blow-by-blow is in `HANDOFF.md` (older) and the session notes below.
Live site: https://oaktend.com. Code: all on `main`, pushed through the commits listed under "Pushed".

> Legacy literals: a few exact strings below still carry the dead brand name because they are
> real values that exist outside this repo, not prose. Seeded test-account emails, the local
> checkout path `C:\Users\lande\hearth`, and the Vercel team slug `hearth-test` are quoted as-is
> so the commands still work. Everything else reads "OakTend".

## Goals (unchanged)

- Ship OakTend mainly as an iPhone App Store app; desktop must not break.
- Simple app feel (Angi-style), keep every standout feature.
- All of Orange County, honest pricing, clean subscription page.
- Safe: ownership on every request, no trial farming, moderated public text.

## Pushed overnight 2026-08-28 (both verified: tsc 0, full vitest green, eslint 0, isolated build 0, red team + checker)

1. `d2b30a2` Streaming Ask OakTend, paywall metering (2 doc reads, 1 inspection, trial 8 asks/day, home value refresh Plus-only), block/report for UGC, speed wave (one auth call per request, 15 public pages static, dashboard 2 query waves, indexes), accessibility and readability pass, phone Plus picker (no Free card, 3 in a row), home details editor, weather clock, header wrap fix, real fix for fake Messages badges, landing demo pause fix, Apple sign-in hidden behind a flag, copy freshness (all of OC, legal dates), health route, Stripe dunning notices, support digest cron, users column lock (0139), 0135 SECURITY INVOKER.
2. `29f5231` Round 2 from the 10-persona run: job post confirmation banner + visible failures, minimal phone landing (1 tap to signup), county-records fix (RentCast 404 = miss, retry, honest manual entry), condo data sanity (no building-level $34M figures), address mismatch choice, pro wizard fixes (empty city start, Other field, draft key per account, chips survive restore, error keeps the form), routing for pro accounts without a company + escape hatch, ghost-protection copy, CSLB digits-only, menu z-order, tap targets, many copy fixes.
3. `e6875a5` Round 3: Ask OakTend transcript fix (second question no longer drops the first answer; answers saved while streaming), pro Ask OakTend entry points, property type on Home details, job-post confirmation for first-time posters, address-mismatch panel fix.
4. `88772a2` Round 4 (from the 10-checker pass): claim path no longer trusts hidden parcel fields; Ask OakTend clear-while-streaming guard, cross-tab clear, empty-answer refund + idempotent refunds, abort-refund cap (5/hour), pro Ask photo gate (Pro only), trial copy; payments: trial reserved before Stripe checkout (no double trials), webhook cannot resurrect a canceled sub, free/Plus/trial numbers interpolated from one constant, dunning id guard; desktop header overlap fixed at 1024+ (address truncates instead of colliding); phone job cards 44px controls, post-job banner scrolls clear of the header, tip box shown once; app guide no longer re-opens after a tab change; pro copy/routing/legal/a11y fixes; 0140 direct-request block gate.

## YOUR morning list (in order; nothing below works until 1 and 2 are done)

1. DONE 2026-08-29: migrations 0129 through 0140 were applied live in one paste. Those one-time paste files were deleted from the repo on 2026-09-12 (all applied; git history has them). The migrations themselves live in `supabase/migrations/`.
2. DONE 2026-08-29: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `RISK_HASH_SALT`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (test mode) set as team SHARED env vars linked to oaktend, old project-level Stripe key deleted, redeployed. (`npx vercel env ls` does not list shared vars; check the dashboard Shared tab.) Original instructions: Vercel > oaktend > Settings > Environment Variables (Production + Preview), values from `C:\Users\lande\hearth\.env.local`: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (edit), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (add; it is NOT set on Vercel at all, which is why Ask OakTend is down on live), `RISK_HASH_SALT` (add; last line of .env.local, never rotate). Then Redeploy.
3. Supabase > Authentication > Sign In / Providers > Email: turn "Confirm email" back ON (I asked you to turn it off for the testers).
4. Stripe dashboard: set the public business name to "OakTend" (checkout showed "Landen Chu"); enable the webhook events `invoice.payment_failed` and `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` on the endpoint.
5. Delete the test accounts when done (SQL, service role):
   `delete from auth.users where email like 'hearth-persona-%' or email like 'hearth-test-%@example.com' or email like 'hearth-redteam-%';`
   (cascades homes, companies "TEST ... (ignore)", CRM clients, TEST (ignore) jobs.) NOTE: the contractor "2e3thyj" is YOUR OWN pro account, do not delete it.
6. Later, before the App Store build: set BOTH `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_SIGN_IN=on` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_SIGNIN=1` on Vercel (two gates, both must be on; Apple requires Sign in with Apple next to Google); read `scratchpad appstore-checklist` summary in the session notes: Plus must be sold through StoreKit/IAP inside the iOS app, block/report now exist, DMCA placeholders and `TODO(legal)` still block submission.

## Decisions I made for you (say if you disagree)

- A RentCast miss (no county record) no longer refuses the home; it proceeds to manual entry with honest copy. Refusing would have blocked real homeowners (4 real OC addresses had no record in one night). Fake addresses are caught by the street-name match against the geocoder.
- Free tier: 2 document AI reads and 1 inspection import per account, then Plus. Trialing accounts get 8 asks/day (paid 15). Home value refresh/trend is Plus; the first estimate stays free.
- Light theme stays the default with a manual toggle (4 testers wanted system dark mode; your earlier decision stands).
- The dashboard "Home value" and "Open jobs" cards are hidden on phones (value lives in Tools, jobs on the Pros tab).
- Block does not cancel an existing job; the confirm copy says so and offers End conversation.

## What the testers liked (3+ sessions each)

Honest Plus page and Stripe terms, 2 to 4 taps to an account, address autocomplete, Ask OakTend answers grounded in the home, the first-login guide, Emergency page, dark mode, plain copy everywhere, loading states.

## Still open (not done tonight)

- Capacitor/iOS wrapper, push, IAP entitlement merge, privacy manifest (App Store checklist in session notes).
- Sentry / uptime monitor (owner accounts needed), Vercel Pro + region match with Supabase.
- 46 `TODO(legal)` placeholders (DMCA agent, business address, pro-terms numbers) for the lawyer.
- Desktop header at 640-1023px still collides (brand vs nav links). Structural: the top strip switches on at `sm` but only fits at ~1024px. Fix is moving the top strip + bottom tab bar from `sm` to `lg`; that gives tablets the app shell, your call.
- Review comments moderation is done; `open_jobs_for_me` already had a LIMIT (old STATUS item was stale).

## Wave 2026-08-29/30 (overnight, pushed with permission)

Gate before push: tsc 0, eslint 0, vitest 178 files / 2463 pass, isolated build 0, two verifier agents (security + regression), fixes from the security review applied by the lead.

What is in code (needs the SQL bundle below to be fully active on live):
- Phone chat composer pinned above the iOS keyboard (visualViewport frame, auto-growing textarea, tab bar hides while typing) on /ask, /chats, /pro/ask, /pro/chats. Ask OakTend daily-limit lock persists across visits.
- Ask OakTend reachable only from Messages (dock, dashboard rows, Tools row, pro menu, /learn pane removed; /search panes kept, owner to decide).
- Weekly = monthly = yearly incl. trial; Plus copy prints no numbers. Pro copilot: free 3/day, Pro 20/day, locked until the business is real (verified license, paid lead, deposit, or membership).
- Checkout: trial reservation is session-scoped and resumable (no more idempotency errors); pro side mirrored; conversion stamped by the webhook.
- Pro side: /pro is Home (greeting, quick actions, 3 tool tiles, asked-for-you, numbers, trend, feedback card, nudge), /pro/leads is the board, 5-tab bar with Home centred; SMS consent checkbox (pro texts were silently dropped before); license/insurance expiry chips; "Find jobs" / "Find clients"; billing tier prices moved to /pro/help#lead-pricing; trial popup on billing visits 1/11/21; footer clears the tab bar.
- Paywall parity on pro: 2 free back-office drafts then Pro (0145), ProChip, ?reason= banners on /pro/plus, once-a-day nudge. Feedback credit: $5 lead credit once per established pro (0144), never tied to store ratings.
- Owner name on pro profiles (0141), contact email editable (Apple relay), prefilled forms, thank-you pages (/contact/thanks, help forms sent state), error toasts fade at 5s, This-month checklist stays open, maintenance plan button stays, Energy card hidden on phone.
- Rating prompt: active-time gate (15-20 min, sessions 2-5 then 1-in-4), honest "Did you get a chance to rate?" follow-up, native adapter for the App Store build (Apple 5.6.1 branch), no incentives.
- Web push (0143 + VAPID env): service worker, subscribe API, push channel in sendNotification (free for everyone, allowlisted kinds), settings cards both sides, one-time prompt; bell opens as a phone sheet that only the X closes.
- Security: 30-day idle sign-out (this device only), password reset link fixed + expired-link notice, log redactor, same-origin guard on mutating routes + coverage test, cron secret pattern test, server-only on secret readers, robots covers all private routes, upload guard (magic bytes, PDF active content, EXIF strip) on the server upload path + bucket caps paste, env guard (staging DB fatal; test Stripe warns until REQUIRE_LIVE_STRIPE=1), realtime subscriptions filtered + replica identity default (0146), RLS audit paste, backups/restore + environments docs.
- Launch polish: share images for 12 guides + pricing + pros, breadcrumbs on 30 pages (+JSON-LD on guides), first-party analytics events both sides (docs/ANALYTICS.md).

Owner to do (historical list; the 0141-0146 paste has since been applied and its file deleted): Vercel env NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY / VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY / VAPID_SUBJECT then redeploy; Supabase Auth settings (sessions, URL config, reset template, secure password change, confirm email ON); run supabase/AUDIT-rls-2026-08-29.sql and send results; confirm the Supabase plan / backups; Vercel firewall rule for /api/health; environments split per docs/ENVIRONMENTS.md; Apple key rotation before Apple sign-in.
