//                 'unsafe-eval' is what Next's dev bundler needs, and only
//                 that: LOW-36, it is now gated to non-production builds (see

//                 security, email-code resend) whenever
//                 NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY is set. It is currently
//                 report-only so this was invisible, but the day this policy
//                 graduates to enforcing (see below) an enforcing CSP without
//                 this entry blocks the script outright and every one of
//                 those forms stops being able to solve the CAPTCHA the

//   style-src   - Tailwind ships real stylesheets, but React inline styles and
//                 the CSS modules' runtime need 'unsafe-inline'.
//   img-src     - blob:/data: cover the local upload previews
//                 (URL.createObjectURL in the upload components), the Supabase
//                 host covers public Storage objects (pro logos).
//   object-src  - FilePreview.tsx renders a PDF thumbnail with
//                 <object data={blob:...}>, which default-src 'self' alone
//                 would flag.
//   connect-src - the browser talks to our own /api routes and to Supabase
//                 (auth + storage over https, realtime over wss). Every other
//                 outbound host (Gemini, Open-Meteo, RentCast, CSLB, Checkr,
//                 Resend, Twilio) is called from server code only.
//                 challenges.cloudflare.com is added here too: Cloudflare's
//                 own CSP guidance for Turnstile lists connect-src alongside
//                 script-src and frame-src, since the widget's loader script
//                 (not just its iframe) issues its own requests to that host.
//   font-src    - next/font/google self-hosts Inter at build time, so fonts
//                 come from our own origin.
//   frame-src   - Turnstile's actual challenge (the checkbox, and any visible
//                 interactive puzzle Cloudflare's risk engine decides to show)
//                 renders inside a cross-origin <iframe> the widget script
//                 creates, which needs frame-src explicitly: default-src
//                 'self' does not cover iframes.
// Report-only means violations are reported, never blocked. Graduate it to the
// enforcing "Content-Security-Policy" key after a burn-in period with no
// unexpected reports.
// LOW-36: 'unsafe-eval' is only needed for Next's DEV bundler (see the
// script-src note above) and shipped unconditionally, so the production CSP
// - Report-Only today, but this is the policy that graduates - carried a
// wider allowance than the app it describes actually needs. Gated on
// NODE_ENV so a production build never sends the token at all; local `next
// dev` (and any verification build that leaves NODE_ENV unset) keeps it.

  // The homepage is dynamic (src/app/page.tsx reads searchParams.code and the

  // the BODY for every user agent except its own built-in list of old-style
  // bots. Googlebot, GPTBot and PerplexityBot were all receiving them in the
  // body (verified against production on 2026-09-20; Bingbot got them in the
  // head). Google only reads page metadata from <head>, and the AI crawlers
  // do not run the script that moves the tags up afterwards.
  //
  // This regex is matched against the User-Agent header; /.*/ matches all of
  // them, which makes metadata blocking for everyone. The anonymous homepage
  // does no network work, so the cost is negligible. Statically generated
  // pages (guides, city pages) already had their metadata in the head and are
  // unaffected. Top level, not under `experimental`: Next 15.2 and later.

  // How much of a request body Next will hand to middleware before it gives
  // up on the rest. Default 10MB, and it TRUNCATES rather than rejecting.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS HERE. src/middleware.ts matches everything except _next and
  // the two public asset folders, so it runs on /api/* too. Next only clones a
  // request body when middleware is in play, and that clone is where the limit
  // lives (next/dist/server/body-streams.js: getCloneableBody takes the size
  // limit from experimental.middlewareClientMaxBodySize, and past it logs
  // "Request body exceeded 10MB ... Only the first 10MB will be available
  // unless configured" and closes BOTH streams, the middleware's copy and the
  // one the route handler goes on to read). So the route does not get a 413 or
  // an error: it gets a truncated body. For /api/ingest-inspection that means
  // a 20MB inspection PDF (~26.7MB once base64'd into JSON, which is why the
  // route's own MAX_BODY_BYTES is 26MB) arrives cut off mid-string, JSON.parse
  // fails, and the owner is told their upload was a bad request - for a file
  // that was exactly the size the page told them to send.
  //
  // 30mb, not 26: it has to clear the route's own ceiling plus the JSON
  // envelope around the base64, and this value is only ever an upper bound on
  // what may be buffered. The real per-route caps do the actual limiting, and
  // they are unchanged - readJsonBounded still cancels the read the moment a
  // body passes MAX_BODY_BYTES, so raising this does not widen what any route
  // will accept, it only stops Next from silently corrupting a body the route
  // was always going to bound itself.
