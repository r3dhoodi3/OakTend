-- RUN THIS AGAINST THE LIVE DATABASE (Supabase SQL editor), once, top to bottom.
--
-- Concatenation, in order, of the five standalone paste files:

--   0165 internal / test accounts  (PASTE-ME-0165-internal-accounts-2026-09-12.sql)
--   0166 campaign attribution      (PASTE-ME-0166-campaign-attribution-2026-09-12.sql)
--   0167 rentcast cache            (PASTE-ME-0167-rentcast-cache-2026-09-12.sql)
--   0168 pro waitlist + home cap   (PASTE-ME-0168-pro-waitlist-2026-09-12.sql)
-- Each section keeps its own PRECHECK guards (order, grants) and is idempotent,
-- so a re-run after a partial failure is safe: finished sections are no-ops.
-- Applies AFTER 0162 (live). 0163 belongs to the unmerged rename branch and is
-- independent of everything here; paste it with that merge.

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_charges_enabled is
  'Mirror of Stripe account.charges_enabled. Written ONLY by service_role, from '
  'the Connect webhook (account.updated) and the on-return sync. Never trust it '
  'as anything but a cache: the authority is Stripe.';

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_payouts_enabled is
  'Mirror of Stripe account.payouts_enabled. Written ONLY by service_role. '
  'Together with stripe_charges_enabled this is what canSendInvoices() '
  '(src/lib/connectStatus.ts) requires before step 2 lets an invoice be sent.';

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_details_submitted is
  'Mirror of Stripe account.details_submitted - the pro finished Express '
  'onboarding, whether or not Stripe has since enabled them. Written ONLY by '
  'service_role. Distinguishes "in progress" from "restricted" on /pro/payouts.';

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_requirements_currently_due is
  'Mirror of Stripe account.requirements.currently_due, the raw requirement '
  'keys. Rendered through humanizeRequirement() in src/lib/connectStatus.ts so '
  'a pro reads "A bank account to pay out to" rather than "external_account". '
  'Written ONLY by service_role.';

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_disabled_reason is
  'Mirror of Stripe account.requirements.disabled_reason, plus the one value '
  'OakTend writes itself: ''deauthorized'', set when Stripe sends '
  'account.application.deauthorized (the pro disconnected OakTend from their '
  'Stripe account). Written ONLY by service_role.';

comment on column public.contractors.stripe_account_synced_at is
  'When the six columns above were last mirrored from Stripe. Also the '
  'out-of-order guard: syncConnectAccount() refuses to apply an event older '
  'than the value already stored, so a late-delivered account.updated cannot '
  'walk a newer state backwards. Written ONLY by service_role.';

-- order guards is a byte-for-byte copy of.
--
-- NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL YOU MARK AN ACCOUNT. Both columns default to false, so
-- applying this file changes no behaviour for anybody. The flag only starts
-- doing anything after the admin one-liner (at the bottom of the copied
-- migration, and in docs/INTERNAL-ACCOUNTS.md) is run for a specific account.
--
-- UNTIL THIS IS PASTED: the app degrades on purpose rather than crashing. Every

-- the LATEST body in supabase/migrations, copied byte-for-byte, plus exactly
-- one predicate or one guard clause. The migration names its source for every
-- single one. The PRECHECK block that follows the order guards fingerprints
-- each of those latest bodies on the live database first and refuses the whole

-- =============================================================================
-- Everything below this line is supabase/migrations/0165_internal_accounts.sql,

-- =============================================================================

-- =============================================================================
-- OakTend - internal / test accounts flag (0165)
-- RUN THIS AGAINST THE LIVE DATABASE (Supabase SQL editor).
--
-- Landen request E4 (2026-09-12): the team's own test accounts - a homeowner
-- account and a contractor account we sign in as to walk the product - are
-- currently indistinguishable from real ones. Their jobs land on the real pro
-- job board, their pro profile shows up in browse/search/the public directory
-- and the sitemap, and a real pro can pay real wallet money to apply to a job
-- that was never a job. This migration marks those accounts and makes them
-- invisible to real users.
--
-- THE RULE, in one line: INTERNAL SEES INTERNAL, REAL SEES ONLY REAL.
--   * an internal homeowner's open jobs and direct requests reach internal
--     pros only; a real homeowner's reach real pros only.
--   * an internal contractor is listed, profiled and reviewable only for an
--     internal homeowner; a real contractor only for a real homeowner. An
--     anonymous visitor is never internal, so the public web only ever sees
--     real pros.
--   * everything else keeps working for the internal accounts themselves.
--     Nothing is hidden from an account about its OWN rows: an internal pro
--     still reads their own contractors row, their own leads, their own chats,
--     their own wallet. The flag only ever filters the OTHER side.
--
-- WHY SYMMETRIC (and not just "hide internal from real"). Both halves are
-- needed for the pairing rules below to be coherent. apply_to_lead /
-- unlock_direct_request refuse a cross-internal pairing in BOTH directions
-- (an internal pro must not pay for a real homeowner's job either - that is
-- real money against a real lead from a test account), so a board that showed
-- an internal pro every real job would be showing them jobs they cannot apply
-- to. The same argument runs on the homeowner side: an internal homeowner who
-- could still see real pros could still send a real pro a direct request.
-- Matching the two flags is the only shape where the list and the action
-- agree. See docs/INTERNAL-ACCOUNTS.md.
--
-- WHAT THIS ADDS
--   Part 1   users.is_internal, contractors.is_internal + two partial indexes
--   Part 2   is_internal_user() / is_internal_contractor() helpers
--   Part 3   0139's column-lock trigger, +1 entry: users.is_internal
--   Part 4   contractors.is_internal follows the owning user (2 triggers)
--   Part 5   open_jobs_for_me()            0161's body + one predicate
--   Part 6   my_direct_requests()          0116's body + one predicate
--   Part 7   "contractors read" policy     0069's body + one predicate
--   Part 8   browse_pros()                 0154's body + one predicate
--   Part 9   public_pro_profile()          0155's body + one predicate
--   Part 10  contractor_reviews()          0138's body + one predicate
--   Part 11  apply_to_lead()               0161's body + one guard clause
--   Part 12  unlock_direct_request()       0153's body + one guard clause
--   Part 13  choose_applicant()            0107's body + one guard clause
--
-- SERVICE-ROLE ONLY, BOTH COLUMNS. This is the whole point of the feature: an
-- account must not be able to un-mark itself (a real account that set
-- is_internal would vanish from every real pro's board while still costing
-- nothing, and an internal account that cleared it would start spending other
-- people's money again).
--   * public.users carries 0139's BEFORE UPDATE column-lock trigger, whose
--     LOCKED list is an explicit allow-list. Part 3 re-creates
--     enforce_users_column_lock() with 0139's body (the LATEST body in this
--     folder - no migration after 0139 re-creates it; grep confirms) and ONE
--     added array entry, 'is_internal'. Service-role and platform-role writes
--     still return early, so every admin-client path is unaffected.
--   * public.contractors needs NOTHING added. 0069 revoked table-level SELECT
--     from authenticated/anon and granted it back column-scoped (id, user_id,
--     name, categories, service_area, rating, review_count, license_number,
--     contact_phone, contact_email, slug, logo_url, about, created_at), and
--     0085 did the same for UPDATE/INSERT (later widened, column by column, by
--     0098 / 0124 / 0128 / 0141 - every one of them a named-column grant).
--     A column that is in none of those lists is not readable and not writable
--     by authenticated or anon. is_internal is in none of them. GRANT NOTHING
--     is therefore the complete answer, and this migration grants nothing on
--     either column - same posture, and the same reasoning, as 0164's Stripe
--     Connect columns.
--   * The "contractors read" policy in Part 7 still REFERENCES is_internal.
--     That is fine and is not a hole: an RLS policy expression is evaluated by
--     the system, not by the querying role, so column privileges never apply
--     to it. The policy can read a column the caller cannot select.
--
-- HELPER FUNCTIONS are SECURITY DEFINER + STABLE + set search_path = public,
-- and do exactly one indexed lookup each. They run inside policies and inside
-- the WHERE clause of list functions, so they have to stay this cheap. STABLE
-- (not VOLATILE) is what lets the planner evaluate is_internal_user(auth.uid())
-- once per query instead of once per row.
--
-- Idempotent: ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE OR
-- REPLACE / DROP + CREATE for functions, DROP + CREATE for policies and
-- triggers. Safe to re-run.
--
-- DEPENDS ON: 0139 (column lock), 0069 (contractors read + column grants),
-- 0085 (contractors column grants), 0107 (choose_applicant), 0116
-- (my_direct_requests), 0138 (contractor_reviews), 0153
-- (unlock_direct_request), 0154 (browse_pros), 0155 (public_pro_profile),
-- 0161 (open_jobs_for_me, apply_to_lead). Run AFTER 0164.

-- The failure this prevents: an internal homeowner account opens the pro side
-- to test it, a contractors row is created by ordinary onboarding, and that
-- row is REAL - it lands in browse, in /p/<id>, in the sitemap, and starts
-- getting real direct requests. Making the pro side inherit the flag on
-- INSERT closes that by construction; nobody has to remember the second half
-- of the admin one-liner.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER on both: they read/write columns the calling role has no
-- privilege on. Neither one trusts anything the caller supplied except
-- new.user_id, which the "contractors insert own" policy (0005) has already
-- pinned to auth.uid() by the time a BEFORE INSERT trigger runs.

-- Part 7: "contractors read" - 0069's policy + the internal-matching predicate
-- =============================================================================
-- 0069's policy (the latest in this folder; 0002 created it and 0057/0059 only
-- mention it in comments) is:
--
--   using ( user_id = auth.uid() or public.contractor_related_to_me(id) )
--
-- and it grows ONE conjunct on the second arm only:
--
--   and coalesce(is_internal, false) = public.is_internal_user(auth.uid())
--
-- THE FIRST ARM IS DELIBERATELY UNTOUCHED. `user_id = auth.uid()` is the pro
-- reading their OWN row, and this feature must never hide an account from
-- itself - an internal pro whose own row went unreadable would be bounced to
-- /pro/onboarding on every page load. Only the "someone else's row" arm is
-- narrowed.
--
-- contractor_related_to_me() itself is NOT re-created. It answers "does this
-- homeowner have a lead or an application with this pro", which is a fact
-- about existing rows and stays true regardless of the flag; putting the
-- predicate in the policy instead keeps the helper single-purpose and keeps
-- this migration to one changed line. Note also that an already-related pair
-- can only exist across the internal boundary if it predates the flag, and in
-- that case hiding the row would break a job already in flight - so the
-- narrowing is applied here, at the directory level, and NOT to the
-- "leads contractor select" policy (0005), which is what a pro's own accepted
-- leads, contacts and chats hang off.
--
-- The policy may read is_internal even though `authenticated` has no SELECT
-- privilege on it (0069's column-scoped grant): RLS expressions are evaluated
-- by the system, not by the querying role.

--
-- BIDIRECTIONAL, deliberately. An internal pro applying to a real job is the

-- actually costs someone: real wallet money against a lead that was never a

--
-- MESSAGE: deliberately vague and identical to 0138's block wording, so it

-- 0107's body byte-for-byte (the latest in this folder: 0107
-- apply_credit_back), plus ONE guard clause and NOT ONE new query.
--
-- WHY NO NEW QUERY: the line immediately above the guard already refuses
-- unless owns_property(cl.property_id) is true for the caller, so by that
-- point the lead owner IS auth.uid(). The guard therefore compares
-- is_internal_user(auth.uid()) against is_internal_contractor(v_contractor) -
-- the applicant being picked, resolved in the first select of the function.
--
-- Placed BEFORE the FOR UPDATE lock on the lead and before every write, so a
-- refused pick assigns nothing, declines nobody, and credits nothing back.
--
-- This pairing is already unreachable through the product (a real pro cannot
-- apply to an internal job and vice versa, Part 11), so this guard only ever
-- fires on an application row that predates the flag. It is here so that the
-- three money functions state the same rule rather than two of them stating it
-- and the third inheriting it.

-- ADMIN: marking an account internal, and unmarking it
-- =============================================================================
-- Also written up in docs/INTERNAL-ACCOUNTS.md. SERVICE ROLE ONLY - run it in
-- the Supabase SQL editor, which connects as a platform role and is therefore
-- waved through enforce_users_column_lock().
--
-- MARK an account (and any pro row it owns) internal:
--
--   update public.users set is_internal = true where email = 'someone@oaktend.test';
--   update public.contractors c set is_internal = true
--     from public.users u where u.id = c.user_id and u.is_internal;
--
-- The second statement is belt-and-braces: users_internal_propagates (Part 4)
-- already carries the flip through to existing contractors rows, and
-- contractors_internal_follows_user stamps any row created later. Run it
-- anyway - it is a no-op when the triggers did their job, and it is the repair
-- if this file was applied to a database whose rows predate it.
--
-- UNMARK (turn a test account back into a real one):
--
--   update public.users set is_internal = false where email = 'someone@oaktend.test';
--   update public.contractors c set is_internal = false
--     from public.users u where u.id = c.user_id and not u.is_internal;
--
-- AUDIT what is currently internal:
--
--   select u.id, u.email, u.is_internal, c.id as contractor_id, c.is_internal
--     from public.users u
--     left join public.contractors c on c.user_id = u.id
--    where u.is_internal or c.is_internal;
--
-- NOTE: contractors.is_internal FOLLOWS THE OWNING USER. Do not set it on its
-- own and expect it to stick - the next time that user's is_internal changes,
-- users_internal_propagates overwrites it.


-- =============================================================================
-- VERIFY (run after applying; each should come back as described)
-- =============================================================================

-- 1. Both columns exist, default false, not null.
--   select table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
--     from information_schema.columns
--    where table_schema = 'public' and column_name = 'is_internal';
--   -> two rows (users, contractors), boolean, NO, false

-- 2. Neither column is readable or writable by authenticated / anon.
--   select grantee, privilege_type, column_name
--     from information_schema.column_privileges
--    where table_schema = 'public'
--      and table_name in ('users', 'contractors')
--      and column_name = 'is_internal'
--      and grantee in ('authenticated', 'anon');
--   -> zero rows for contractors. (public.users has no column-level grants at
--      all - it is guarded by the trigger instead; check 3 covers it.)

-- 3. The column lock carries is_internal.
--   select prosrc like '%''is_internal''%' from pg_proc
--    where proname = 'enforce_users_column_lock'
--      and pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace;
--   -> t

-- 4. Every re-created read path carries the predicate.
--   select proname, prosrc like '%is_internal_user(auth.uid())%'
--     from pg_proc
--    where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
--      and proname in ('open_jobs_for_me', 'my_direct_requests', 'browse_pros',
--                      'public_pro_profile', 'contractor_reviews');
--   -> t for all five

-- 5. Every money function carries the guard.
--   select proname, prosrc like '%internal_account%' from pg_proc
--    where pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace
--      and proname in ('apply_to_lead', 'unlock_direct_request',
--                      'choose_applicant');
--   -> t for all three

-- 6. The contractors read policy carries it.
--   select polname, pg_get_expr(polqual, polrelid) like '%is_internal%'
--     from pg_policy
--    where polrelid = 'public.contractors'::regclass and polname = 'contractors read';
--   -> t

-- 7. Dry run, on a copy. Mark one homeowner + one pro internal with the admin
--    one-liner above, then:
--    a. as a REAL pro: select * from public.open_jobs_for_me();
--       -> the internal homeowner's open job is absent; real jobs unchanged.
--    b. as the INTERNAL pro: the same call lists the internal job and NO real
--       job.
--    c. as a REAL homeowner: select * from public.browse_pros(null);
--       -> the internal pro is absent.
--       select public.public_pro_profile('<internal contractor id>');  -> null
--       select * from public.contractor_reviews('<internal contractor id>');
--       -> zero rows
--    d. anonymously (anon key): public_pro_profile on the internal pro -> null,
--       so /p/<id>, its OG card and /api/pro-widget/<id> all 404.
--    e. as the INTERNAL pro: select public.apply_to_lead('<a REAL lead id>', null);
--       -> raises 'This job is not available to you.' and writes nothing to
--          wallets, lead_applications or wallet_transactions.
--    f. as a REAL pro: the same call against the INTERNAL homeowner's lead ->
--       the same raise, again with no money moved.
--    g. as the INTERNAL pro against the INTERNAL homeowner's lead -> applies
--       normally. Real pro + real lead -> applies normally.
--    h. as the internal pro: /pro still loads, their own contractors row still
--       reads, their own /p/<id> still renders. Nothing is hidden from an
--       account about itself.

-- #############################################################################

-- =============================================================================
-- PASTE-ME-0166-campaign-attribution-2026-09-12.sql   (built 2026-09-12)
-- Migration 0166 only: permanent campaign/partner attribution on public.users,
-- plus the two service-role-only reporting views behind it.
--
-- Live is expected to be through 0162 (PASTE-ME-ALL-PENDING-2026-09-08.sql).
-- 0164 (Stripe Connect) and 0165 (internal accounts) are separate files being
-- prepared alongside this one - see THE ONE ORDERING RULE below, which is the
-- only thing about this file that is order-sensitive.
--
-- Paste the WHOLE file into the Supabase SQL editor and run it once. It is one
-- transaction: if any section raises, nothing is applied - read the message,
-- fix the cause, re-run the whole file. Every statement is idempotent, so
-- running it twice is a no-op, not an error.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES:
--   1. adds public.users.campaign_code + campaign_recorded_at, a CHECK on the
--      code shape, and one partial index;
--   2. re-creates the public.users column-lock trigger function so an account
--      cannot rewrite its own attribution;
--   3. creates public.campaign_signups_by_month and
--      public.campaign_upgrades_by_month, revoked from anon/authenticated and
--      granted to service_role only.
-- It grants NOTHING new to authenticated/anon. See the long header in
-- supabase/migrations/0166_users_campaign_attribution.sql, which this file is
-- a copy of with the guards below added on top.
--
-- THE ONE ORDERING RULE. Section 2 uses CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION on
-- public.enforce_users_column_lock(), which replaces the body WHOLESALE. Any
-- OTHER migration that also re-creates that function (0165/internal accounts
-- is expected to, for `is_internal`) must be pasted BEFORE this file, or it
-- will un-lock whatever this file locked. PRECHECK 3 below enforces this
-- automatically: it reads the function currently installed on the database and
-- REFUSES the whole paste if it locks a public.users column that this file's
-- list would drop. You cannot get the order wrong silently.
--
-- UNTIL THIS IS PASTED: the app degrades on purpose rather than crashing. The
-- attribution write in src/app/(auth)/recordTermsAcceptance.ts goes through
-- isMissingSchemaError (src/lib/dbErrors.ts) - a missing column logs one
-- warning and continues. The campaign_signup analytics event still lands and
-- sign-up is completely unaffected, so there is no deploy-order requirement
-- between the app and this file. What you lose until it is pasted is only the
-- permanent per-account record, which app_events cannot replace long-term.
--
-- NOTE: this file does not backfill. Accounts created through /go/<code>
-- BEFORE it is pasted keep campaign_code null; their campaign_signup rows in
-- app_events are the only record of them.
-- =============================================================================

-- ---- ORDER GUARD 1: do not paste this out of order ------------------------

-- bundle, and its index is the cheapest proof that bundle actually ran. If it
-- is missing, this database is behind and the earlier bundle has to go first.

-- These are the whole read side of the partner deal - docs/REFERRALS.md has

--
-- NOT security_invoker. Left at the default (the view runs with its OWNER's
-- privileges), which is what lets it read across public.users despite the
-- "users self select" RLS policy. That is safe ONLY because of the REVOKEs
-- below: no role that could be a browser session may select from either view.
--
-- THE REVOKES ARE THE ACTUAL ACCESS CONTROL, not decoration. Supabase's
-- default privileges in the public schema grant SELECT on new objects to anon
-- and authenticated automatically, so a view created here would be
-- world-readable through PostgREST unless the grant is taken back.

-- ---- Sign-ups per code per month -------------------------------------------
-- One row per (code, month), counting ACCOUNTS. Month comes from
-- campaign_recorded_at, stamped in the same UPDATE as the code, so it is the
-- sign-up month by construction; coalesced to created_at only to stay sane if
-- a row is ever backfilled by hand with a code but no timestamp.

-- ---- Upgrades per code per month -------------------------------------------
-- "Upgrade" = the attributed account holds a HOMEOWNER-side subscription row
-- that reached status 'active'. public.subscriptions (0025, re-keyed to one
-- row per (user_id, side) by 0039) is the table the Stripe webhook
-- (src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts) writes; side = 'pro' is the
-- contractor plan and is deliberately excluded - a partner referral deal is
-- about homeowners.
--
-- 'active' ONLY, not 'trialing'. src/lib/subscription.ts draws exactly this
-- line: 'trialing' means live but nothing has been charged yet. A commission
-- is paid out of money that actually moved.
--
-- THE MONTH IS AN APPROXIMATION, AND THIS IS THE CAVEAT TO READ. public.
-- subscriptions has created_at (row first written, i.e. checkout) and
-- updated_at (last webhook write, which moves on every renewal, plan change
-- and cancellation). Neither is "the moment this subscription first became
-- paid" - the table has no such column. created_at is used because it is
-- STABLE (updated_at would silently re-bucket an account into a later month
-- on its next renewal, so last month's number would change every time you ran
-- it) and because for the ordinary path - checkout, immediate charge - it is
-- right. It is early by the length of the trial for an account that started
-- on a trial and converted later. If exact became-paid-at months are ever
-- needed, that is a new column on public.subscriptions written by the
-- webhook, not a change to this view.

-- from it silently and start missing every cache hit.
--
-- kind is the endpoint, because the two have different lifetimes: a property
-- record is permanent ('ok' served forever; a 'not_found' is re-asked after 90
-- days because coverage improves) and an estimate is not (served for 30 days). A 'quota' or 'error' row of either kind is served for
-- one hour - long enough that an outage costs one call instead of one per page
-- load, short enough that a transient failure is not frozen in front of a home
-- for the rest of the day.

--
-- INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER PENDING PASTES. 0164 (Stripe Connect), 0165
-- (internal accounts), 0166 (campaign attribution) and 0167 (RentCast cache)
-- are separate files from separate changes; this one neither reads nor writes
-- anything they add, so it can be pasted before or after any of them. The one
-- soft dependency is a FEATURE one, not a SQL one: until 0165 is applied,
-- users.is_internal does not exist, isInternalUser() answers false for
-- everybody, and preview mode blocks the OakTend team from the contractor side
-- along with everyone else. Paste 0165 first if the team needs to test pro.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES, and why both halves are no-ops until the app is switched on:
--   PART 1  adds public.pro_waitlist - the emails collected by the "Pros are
--           coming soon" page. Nothing writes to it until the app runs with
--           NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE=homeowner. Service-role only: RLS on,
--           zero policies, anon/authenticated revoked. It holds contractors'
--           email addresses, so that is not optional.
--   PART 2  adds ONE clause to public.enforce_properties_home_cap() (0108):
--           a service-role insert returns early instead of being counted.
--           Preview mode gives every homeowner the Plus 5-home allowance, but
--           that trigger reads the subscriptions table and a preview homeowner
--           has no row there, so their second home would be refused. Nothing
--           a browser can do changes: `authenticated` and `anon` inserts hit
--           the identical 1/5 count they always have, and outside preview the
--           app never uses the admin client for this insert at all.
--
-- THE SWITCH ITSELF IS NOT IN THIS FILE. It is a Vercel environment variable:
--   NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE=homeowner   -> preview on
--   (unset, or anything else)            -> normal behaviour
-- NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars are inlined at BUILD time, so changing it means changing
-- the variable in Vercel and REDEPLOYING - the same commit is fine, no code
-- change. See docs/GO-LIVE-WIRING.md, "Preview mode".

-- constraint: that list lives in TypeScript, it changes with the product, and
-- a stale constraint here would start rejecting signups in a trade we just
-- added. The action drops any value outside the list before it gets here.

-- ONE ROW PER EMAIL, case-insensitively. This is also the whole

-- "You're on the list." for a new signup and a repeat one. Without this index
-- a repeat signup would insert a second row and the table would slowly become

--
-- Deliberately an EXPRESSION index rather than a `unique (email)` constraint,
-- because "Sam@Example.com" and "sam@example.com" are one contractor. Note
-- that this means PostgREST cannot use it as an ON CONFLICT target (it takes

Read it with: select email, trade, city, source, created_at from public.pro_waitlist order by created_at desc;';


-- =============================================================================
-- Part 2: let a SERVICE-ROLE insert past the home cap
-- =============================================================================
-- THE ONLY CHANGE from the LIVE body is the six-line v_role block and the
-- `if v_role = 'service_role' ... return new` that follows it. Everything
-- below that point - the advisory lock, the Plus predicate, the paid
-- extra-home slots (0110), the 1 / 5 + slots cap, the count, both exception
-- messages with the OakTend wording (0154_oaktend_rename_messages) - is the
-- latest body byte for byte. The trigger was created in 0108, re-created
-- with extra_home_slots in 0110, and re-created with the brand rename in
-- 0154_oaktend_rename_messages; THAT is the body this file extends. (A first
-- draft of this file extended 0108's body instead, which would have silently
-- dropped the paid extra-home slots and put "Hearth" back in an error a
-- homeowner sees. Caught at review 2026-09-12 before it was pasted.) Diff it
-- against supabase/migrations/0154_oaktend_rename_messages.sql before pasting.
--
-- WHY THIS IS SAFE. service_role is the platform's all-powerful role: it
-- already bypasses RLS on every table in the database, and anyone holding that
-- key can drop this trigger outright. A trigger clause that trusts it is not
-- giving away anything it did not already have. What it DOES do is make the
-- trust explicit and auditable in one place, instead of preview mode trying to
-- fake a subscriptions row.
--
-- WHY IT IS RECOGNISED THIS WAY. Two independent signals, either one enough,
-- copied from the same block in 0139 (enforce_users_column_lock), 0165 and
-- 0166 - this repo's established way of saying "the server did this":
--   * the JWT claim. PostgREST puts the verified claims in the
--     `request.jwt.claims` GUC, so `->> 'role'` is what Supabase's own
--     auth.role() reads. Taken through nullif and a sub-block so a missing GUC
--     (a direct psql session) or a malformed one can never throw here.
--   * current_user. PostgREST connects as `authenticator` and SETs the role
--     named by the token, so an admin-client request really is running as
--     `service_role`. postgres / supabase_admin are the platform's own roles:
--     the SQL editor and the owner fixing a row by hand.
-- `authenticated` and `anon` - which is every request a browser can make, and
-- every request a normal (non-preview) deploy makes - are untouched and still
-- counted exactly as before.
--
-- WHAT STILL HOLDS THE LINE IN PREVIEW. The app-side check in
-- claimPropertyAction (src/app/onboarding/actions.ts) is unchanged and still
-- computes the same cap; the admin-client insert is scoped to the VERIFIED
-- user id, never to an id off the request body. So the cap is still 5 homes in
-- preview - it is simply enforced by the action rather than by this trigger,
-- which is the same relationship the app and the trigger have always had (0108
-- calls itself "the backstop" and the action "the primary guard").
--
-- NOT GATED ON PREVIEW MODE, and it cannot be: NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_MODE is an
-- application environment variable and this function runs inside Postgres,
-- which has no way to read it. The gate is on the CALLER instead - only the
-- app decides to use the admin client, and only in preview.
