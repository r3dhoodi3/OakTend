-- OakTend - no applicant cap on a posted job (0170)
--
-- WHAT CHANGES. Exactly one block comes out of public.apply_to_lead(): the
-- applicant cap, which refused a fourth live (non-refunded) application with
--
--     if (select count(*) from lead_applications
--         where lead_id = p_lead and refunded_at is null) >= 3 then
--       raise exception 'Job is full';
--     end if;
--
-- Nothing else moves. Every other guard and every charge path below is 0165's
-- body (Part 11) byte for byte: the chargeback freeze (0132), the Orange
-- County gate (0087) and the launch-city gate (0124), the member/aging
-- pricing and discount_kind (0149), the idempotent already-applied return,
-- the big-job insurance gate (0153), the SEC-1 self-apply guard (0161), the
-- internal-accounts guard (0165), the block check (0138), the one-live-lead
-- relationship rule (0060), the wallet FOR UPDATE (0065/0067), the major
-- intro price (0113), the FIFO bonus drain, the debit, and both inserts.
--
-- WHY. Founder decision 2026-09-16 (addendum 6): there is no cap on how many
-- pros can apply to a job. The homeowner sees every applicant in one list,
-- compares them, and picks. A pro who is ready to work is never turned away
-- because three others got there first, and a homeowner with an awkward job is
-- never left holding three applicants who all passed on it. Contact details
-- still stay private until the pick - that is choose_applicant's job, and it
-- is untouched by this file.
--
-- THE ROW LOCK STAYS. The `for update` on contractor_leads is NOT removed.
-- 0149's comment justified it by the cap, but the cap was never the only thing
-- it serialized: it is the same row lock choose_applicant() takes before it
-- assigns a job, so it is what stops a pro being charged for a lead in the
-- same instant the homeowner is picking somebody else, and it is what makes
-- the assigned/status reads below trustworthy. Only its comment changes here.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT. CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION with the unchanged signature
-- (uuid, text) -> boolean, so the existing EXECUTE grant to `authenticated` is
-- preserved, exactly as 0149, 0153, 0161 and 0165 each relied on. No new
-- objects, no data migration, no row is touched. Safe to re-run.
--
-- THE APP SIDE, in the same change: src/lib/constants.ts drops
-- MAX_APPLICANTS_PER_JOB, the leads board drops its "Job full" state and its
-- full-card branch, applyToJobAction drops the 'Job is full' error copy, and
-- the aging-deals and pro-weekly-digest crons stop filtering jobs out for
-- having applicants. Nothing in the app matches on 'Job is full' any more.
