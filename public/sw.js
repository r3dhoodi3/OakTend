/* OakTend service worker.
 *
 * TWO JOBS: receive Web Push messages and show them as notifications when the
 * app is closed, and paint a precached warming screen when a full-page
 * navigation stalls on a serverless cold start (the installed PWA reopens at
 * its last URL, and on a cold start that is a blank screen for many seconds).
 * It caches exactly ONE thing, /warming.html, and still never caches real
 * pages or data: an offline mode would mean deciding what a stale dashboard is
 * allowed to show, and a caching service worker that gets it wrong serves
 * yesterday's data forever, which is far worse than a "no connection" page.
 * The fetch handler below never reads the cache for anything but the warming
 * screen, so that failure stays impossible.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript, no bundler: this file is served verbatim from /sw.js (it
 * lives in public/), so it cannot use TypeScript, imports from src, or any
 * syntax older browsers choke on. Registered by src/components/PushRegistrar.tsx.
 *
 * Bump VERSION on every meaningful change. The browser byte-compares the
 * fetched worker against the installed one and only treats it as an update if
 * something differs, so the constant is what guarantees a change here actually
 * ships. skipWaiting + clients.claim mean the new worker takes over on the next
 * page load instead of waiting for every tab to close.

  // handler did not exist.
  //   - Non-GET: form posts and server actions must never be raced against a
  //     timer or answered with a cached page.
  //   - Non-navigations: API calls, scripts, styles, images, and prefetches
  //     have their own loading states; only a full-page navigation can strand
  //     someone on a blank screen.
  //   - Cross-origin: Stripe, Supabase, and everything else external is not
  //     ours to intercept.
  //   - /auth/: those GETs consume one-time codes (the OAuth callback's PKCE
  //     code, the email-confirmation token_hash). The timeout never aborts the
  //     underlying fetch, so the server can consume the code while the client
  //     sees the warming screen, and the screen's retry would then replay a
  //     spent code and strand a signed-in user on a sign-in error. Better a
  //     few blank seconds than a broken sign-in.
  //   - /api/: nothing under /api is a page. Downloads reach here too (a
  //     browser routes an <a download> click through this handler as a
  //     navigation), and hijacking a slow export into the warming screen
  //     would regenerate the export on every retry and never hand the file
